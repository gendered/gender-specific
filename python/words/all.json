Voice is produced when air is driven by the muscles of expiration from the lungs through the trachea and strikes against the two vocal cords (see cord), the vibrations of which produce sounds varying in different animals according to the structure of the organs and the power which the animal possesses over them. Voice can, therefore, be found only in animals in which this svstem of respiration is developed, and the lungs and larynx (or syrinx) actually exist. Fishes, having no lnngs, are dumb, as far as true vocal utterance is concerned, though various noises may issue from their throats (see croaker, grunt, and drum). In man the superior organization and mobility of the tongue and lips, as well as the perfection of the larynx, enable him to modify his vocal sounds to an almost infinite extent. In ordinary speaking the tones of the voice have nearly all the same pitch, and the variety of the sounds is due rather to the action of the mouth-organs than to definite movements of the glottis and vocal cords. In singing the successive sounds correspond more or less closely to the ideal tones of the musical scale. The male voice admits of division into tenor and bass, and the female into soprano and contralto. The lowest female tone is an octave or so higher than the lowest tone of the male voice; and the female's highest tone is about an octave above that of the male. The compass of both voices taken together is four octaves or more, the chief differences residing in the pitch and also in the timbre. In medicine, voice is the sound of utterance as transmitted through the lungs and chest-wall in auscultation. In zoology, voice is ordinarily restricted to respiratory sounds or vocal utterance, as above explained, and as distinguished from any mechanical noise, like stridulation, etc. The more usual word for the voice of any animal is cry; and the various cries, distinctive or characteristic of certain animals, take many distinctive terms, according to their vocal quality, as bark, bay, bellow, bleat, bray, cackle, call, caw, chatter, chirp, chirrup, cluck, coo, croak, crow, gabble, gobble, growl, grunt, hiss, honk, hoot, howl, low, mew, neigh, peep, pipe, purr, quack, roar, scream, screech, snarl, snort, song, squall, squawk, squeak, squeal, trumpet, twitter, warble, waul, whine, whinny, whistle, whoop, yawp, yell, yelp, and many others. The voices of some animals, as certain monkeys and large carnivores and ruminants, may be heard a mile; or more. The voice reaches its highest development, in animals other than human, in the distinctively musical class of birds, some of which, notably parrots and certain corvine and sturnoid birds, can be taught to talk intelligible speech.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "voice", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "a female officer who presides at the meetings of a committee, meeting, or organization; a female chairperson.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "chairwoman", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "Civility or polite attention to ladies; in a bad sense, attention or courtesy designed to win criminal favors from a female; freedom of principle or practice with respect to female virtue; intrigue.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "gallantry", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "A female (sometimes a male) servant who had charge of a dairy and all things pertaining to it; a female servant in general.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "dey", "gender": "male"}, {"definition": "A female servant or personal attendant; a female assistant: often used figuratively.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "handmaid", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "The periodic state of sexual excitement in the female of most mammals, excluding humans, that immediately precedes ovulation and during which the female is most receptive to mating; heat.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "estrus", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "See female circumcision.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "clitoridectomy", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "the female reproductive cell; the female gamete", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "ovum", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "The reproductive structure of some seed-bearing plants, characteristically having either specialized male or female organs or both male and female organs, such as stamens and a pistil, enclosed in an outer envelope of petals and sepals.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "flower", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "a distinguished female operatic singer; a female operatic star", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "diva", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "one having both male and female sexual characteristics and organs; at birth an unambiguous assignment of male or female cannot be made", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "intersex", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "a form of social organization in which a female is the family head and title is traced through the female line", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "matriarchy", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "one having both male and female sexual characteristics and organs; at birth an unambiguous assignment of male or female cannot be made", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "androgyne", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "one having both male and female sexual characteristics and organs; at birth an unambiguous assignment of male or female cannot be made", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "epicene", "gender": "male"}, {"definition": "a general term for female steroid sex hormones that are secreted by the ovary and responsible for typical female sexual characteristics", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "estrogen", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "A family of animals descended from some particular female progenitor, through the female line.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "tribe", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "In grammar, a formal distinction in words, apparently founded on and in part expressing differences of sexual character, as male and female, or as male, female, or of neither sex (neuter).", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "gender", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "Collectively, the occupants of a harem, consisting in a Mohammedan family of the wife, or wives (usually to the number of four), female relatives of the husband, female slaves or concubines, and sometimes eunuchs as guardians and attendants.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "harem", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "An adult female hog; the female of swine.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "sow", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "The quality or power of producing fruit; fruitfulness; especially (Biol.), the quality in female organisms of reproducing rapidly and in great numbers.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "fecundity", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "The dried leaves or the female flowers of the hemp plant, which is smoked or chewed to obtain a euphoric effect.

Malignant tumors growby infiltration and destruction of the surrounding tissues, and are characterized by a tendency to recur after removal, by the property of spreading to other parts of the body by a process of dissemination known as metastasis, and by producing a general disturbance of health termed cachexia. From the standpoint, of the pathologist two chief groups of cancerous tumors are recognized: the carcinomata, or true cancers, and the sarcomata. The fundamental difference between these two is the fact that carcinoma originates in the epithelial tissues of the body, whereas sarcoma develops from the connective tissues. This difference in origin gives rise to certain structural characteristics which enable the microscopist readily to distinguish one type from the other. Carcinoma is rare before the age of thirty; it is somewhat commoner in women than in men; and it is most often seen in the uterus, skin, breast, and stomach. Sarcoma is a disease of early adult life, is more prone to attack men than women, and is commonly found in the subcutaneous tissue, bony structures, and lymph-nodes. Carcinoma is conveyed from one part of the body to another through the lymphatic vessels, sarcoma by way of the blood-stream. In spite of an enormous amount of research devoted to this subject, the exciting cause of cancer is still unknown. The influences of heredity, climate, food, race, social condition, and local injury have all been invoked as factors concerned, but without arriving at any degree of certainty. The theory referring the developmentof malignant tumors to the presence of minute animal or vegetable organisms has numerous adherents, but it has not been definitely established, and many prominent authorities consider that the explanation is to be sought for in a disturbance of some still undiscovered fundamental law governing the growth of cells. Although it appears that cancer is increasing somewhat in frequency, the percentage of cures is increasing much more rapidly, owing to the earlier diagnoses and more thorough operations which are now possible. Extirpation by the knife as promptly and as completely as possible, when the growth is accessible, is regarded as the method of treatment that offers the greatest hope of a cure; but the employment of the X-rays or other form of radioactivity has in a number of instances given excellent results.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "cancer", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "An arrangement of lace or tulle, looped ornamentally, and worn by women on the front of the dress.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "jabot", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "A strong, and by some considered exaggerated, sense of manly pride, associated with an attitude that the proper expression of masculinity includes virility, courage, and an entitlement to dominate, especially over women.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "machismo", "gender": "male"}, {"definition": "A charmer of women.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "masher", "gender": "male"}, {"definition": "A demon; a fiend; a lascivious spirit, supposed to have sexual intercourse with women by night.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "incubus", "gender": "male"}, {"definition": "One of a sect of Anabaptists, in the fifteenth and early part of the sixteenth century, who rejected many of the customs and decencies of life, and advocated a community of goods and of women.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "libertine", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "One who dangles about or after others, especially after women; a trifler.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "dangler", "gender": "male"}, {"definition": "a device shaped like an erect penis, used by some women for sexual stimulation.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "dildo", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "A nocturnal festivity with which the Australian aborigines celebrate tribal events of importance.

Of the mineral salts chlorids predominate, the amount, varying between 10 and 15 grams, being largely dependent upon the quantity ingested. As this in turn is greatly influenced by the appetite, the elimination of chlorids is, generally speaking, a fair index of the latter. Of other mineral salts sulphates and phosphates of the alkalis and the alkaline earths predominate; in addition there are traces of fluorides and nitrates. Among the organic waste products which appear in the urine of man urea is the most important. Fully 85 per cent. of the nitrogenous tissue-waste appears in this form. The daily amount varies to a great extent with the appetite and accordingly with the quantity of nitrogenous food consumed, but is on the whole fairly constant for one and the same individual: 20\u201330 grams per day may be regarded as a fair average, but, as overeating is on the whole very common, an elimination of 40\u201350 grams is not infrequently noted. In some of the lower animals, notably in birds and reptiles, uric acid is the principal nitrogenous component of the urine, while urea is found only in small amounts. In man it is unusual to meet with larger quantities than 0.6\u20131.0 gram in the twenty-four hours. In birds and reptiles it is formed synthetically in a manner quite analogous to the production of urea, but in man this mode of formation has not been satisfactorily demonstrated. Its origin here is to be sought in the destruction of nucleins, the resultant xanthin bases giving rise to uric acid on oxidation. Xanthin bases, comprising xanthin, hypoxanthin, guanine, carnin, paraxanthin, heteroxanthin, and episarcine, are found normally only in very small quantity; generally speaking, this represents about 10 per cent. of the amount of uric acid. Theobromine and caffein (derived from cocoa and coffee and tea, respectively) are partly eliminated in the urine as such, while in part they appear as methyl-xanthin (heteroxanthin). Among other organic components which are normally found in the urine are oxalic and oxaluric acid, creatinine, allantoin, hippuric acid, phenol, cresol, pyrocatechin, hydroquinone, indican, scatoxyl sulphate, glycuronic acid, various fatty acids, certain neutral sulphur bodies, such as sulphocyanides, oxy- and alloxy-proteinic acid, various pigments, ferments, etc. Collectively, these bodies are only present in very small amounts: they are in part of tissue origin, that is, metabolic waste products, and in part products of albuminous putrefaction, formed in the intestinal canal. Among the latter indican and scatoxyl sulphate merit especial attention. The mother-substances of the two are indol and skatol, respectively, which, after oxidation to indoxyl and scatoxyl, unite with sulphuric acid, and are then eliminated as the corresponding sodium and potassium salts. Both indoxyl and scatoxyl are chromogens and on oxidation give rise to various pigments, of which the indigo blue derived from indican is the most abundant. The amount of the latter is, roughly speaking, an index of the degree of intestinal putrefaction. Under certain conditions, which are as yet but little understood but which can scarcely be classified as pathological, still other substances appear in the urine, among which cystin and alkapton (homogentisinic acid) are the most noteworthy. Both cystinuria and alkaptonuria are the expression of curious metabolic anomalies. Both may occur in families, and commonly appear early in life and persist throughout. In the case of alkaptonuria it has been shown that consanguinity of the parents may be an etiological factor, but in cystinuria this is not the case. Neither condition per se is pathological, but, owing to the readiness with which cystin separates from the urine in solid form, and the resultant disturbances in the course of the urinary tract, cystinuria in a general way tends to shorten life. Associated with cystinuria there is at times diaminuria (appearance of putrescin and cadaverin). Under pathological conditions marked quantitative variations occur both in the amount of urine per se,, as also in its various normal components, depending to a great-extent upon diminished ingestion of food and increased tissue-waste. Of abnormal constituents which may be met with in disease, the most notable are the serum albumin and serum globulin of the blood, blood as such, albumoses, sugar (dextrose), diacetic acid, beta-oxybutyric acid, lactic acid, biliary constituents, chyle, certain abnormal chromogens, pigments, etc. Traces of albumin may be met with in some individuals who are apparently in perfect health (physiological albuminuria), but, generally speaking, albuminuria is a pathological phenomenon, though not necessarily the indication of a nephritis. The renal epithelium responds to any abnormal stimulus with albuminuria, and it is thus readily understood that the condition may be merely temporary and of comparatively little significance. Long-continued albuminuria, however, especially when occurring in individuals who have reached maturity, and in whom a direct cause of the anomaly is not at once apparent, should always be viewed with anxiety. The amount of albumin which may appear in the urine varies from just discernible traces to 1.5\u20133 per cent. The largest amounts of albumin are met with in a comparatively rare disease, multiple myelomatosis, in which a peculiar albuminous substance, differing from the common albumins of the blood, is met with, the so-called albumin of Bence Jones. The daily elimination may here equal the entire amount of the blood albumins. The elimination of glucose (glucosuria), like that of albumin, is essentially an abnormal phenomenon, and is observed in a large number of pathological conditions, but may also follow the ingestion of excessive amounts of sugar in normal individuals. In disease it may be either temporary or permanent. The latter occurs in diabetes mellitus. In such cases, particularly when advanced, acetone, diacetic, and betaoxybutyric acid are also present, but may likewise occur in other conditions. The ensemble, however, is especially characteristic of the disease in question. Biliary constituents are met with whenever the outflow of bile through the natural channels is impeded. Of the pathological chromogens, finally, one merits especial consideration. It is met with notably in typhoid fever, and on treatment with diazobenzone sulphonic acid, in the presence of ammonia, such urine gives rise to a garnet-red color. Its presence, though observed in other pathological conditions also, is especially constant in typhoid fever and of distinct diagnostic importance. In cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, where the reaction is also encountered, its occurrence is generally viewed as a symptom of grave prognostic import. The chemical nature of the substance in question has not been satisfactorily established.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "urine", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "A perpetual or continuing right which a man and his heirs have to an estate; an estate which a man has by descent as heir to another, or which he may transmit to another as his heir; an estate derived from an ancestor to an heir in course of law.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "inheritance", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "One of the two fleshy folds which surround the orifice of the mouth in man and many other animals.

Knowledge has several steps, as the perception of facts, the accumulation of facts, and familiarity by experience, but it does not include action, nor the power of judging what is best in ends to be pursued or in means for attaining those ends. Prudence is sometimes the power of judging what are the best means for attaining desired ends; it may be a word or action, or it may be simply the power to avoid danger. It implies deliberation and care, whether in acting or refraining from action. Wisdom chooses not only the best means but also the best ends; it is thus far higher than prudence, which may by choosing wrong ends go altogether astray; hence also it is often used in the Bible for piety. As compared with knowledge, it sees more deeply into the heart of things and more broadly and comprehensively sums up relations, draws conclusions, and acts upon them; hence a man may abound in knowledge and be very deficient in wisdom, or he may have a practical wisdom with a comparatively small stock of knowledge. Discretion is the power to judge critically what is correct and proper, sometimes without suggesting action, but more often in view of action proposed or possible. Like prudence the word implies great caution, and takes for granted that a man will not act contrary to what he knows. Providence looks much further ahead than prudence or discretion, and plans and acts according to what it sees. It may be remarked that provision, which is from the same root as providence and prudence, is primarily a word of action, while they are only secondarily so. Forecast is a grave word for looking carefully forward to the consequences of present situations and decisions; it implies, like all these words except knowledge, that one will act according to what he can make out of the future.

In the Greek church the reader (anagnost) ranks below a subdeacon, and it is his office, as it was in the early church, to read the Epistle, the deacon reading the Gospel. In the Church of England the order fell into abeyance after the Reformation, but lay readers were frequently licensed, especially in churches or chapels without a clergyman. They could not minister the sacraments and other rites of the church, except the burial of the dead and the churching of women, nor pronounce the absolution and benediction. Of late years, however, bishops have regularly admitted candidates to the office of reader by delivery of a copy of the New Testament. In the American Episcopal Church lay readers conduct services in vaeant churches or under a rector by his request with license from the bishop for a definite period (a year or less). They cannot give absolution or benediction, administer sacraments, nor use the occasional offices of the church except those for the burial of the dead and visitation of the sick and prisoners, nor deliver sermons of their own composition.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "reader", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "Scraps of paper strewed on the ground by the pursued in the boys' game of hare and hounds, or by the \u201cfox\u201d in a paper-hunt, to enable the pursuers to track them or him.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "scent", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "In mining: The right to enter the mine and work.

This is also true in the eye region. Therefore giving the impression that Asians have smaller eyes when this is not true.\r\r-Asians have small penises: FALSE! Almost all academic study and scientific research ever undertaken has proven that Asian penises are just as large as Caucasian penises. The average for both are approximately 5.5 to 6 inches. However, Asian men do not stray far from this average, whilst Caucasian men do. For every Caucasian man with a 9 inch penis, there is one with a 3 inch one. And for every Asian with a 7 inch penis, there is one with a 5 inch one. There are more Caucasians with large penises, but there are also more Caucasians with smaller penises. Yes, penises smaller than Asians. This is fact! This information has also been known for a long time, but people like to perpetuate myths.\r\r-Asians are short: This is not genetic and not necessarily true. A lot of Asians are short due to diet. It lacks protein and dairy. It is healthier and hence Asians tend to live longer, but it does not promote physical growth as much. However, for Asians with a \"Western\" diet, they tend to be just as tall, if not taller than their Caucasian counterparts. A lot of the tallest people on earth are Asian. A famous example is NBA star Yao Ming.\r\r- Asians are smart: This stereotype is actually true. Asians have one of the highest average IQ's in the world. The average Asian American IQ is approximately 120, whilst the Average Caucasian American is approximately 100. However, just like penis size, the IQ varies greatly for Caucasians and less for Asians. There is a higher percentage of Caucasians with very high IQ's (around 150) than Asians. Although for every Caucasian with an IQ of 150, there are Caucasians with an IQ of only 50.\r\r- All Asians are rich/poor: There is a stereotype that Asians are either really rich or poor third world people. Since the two conflict with each other, it is obvious that neither is true. There are rich and poor Asians, just like rich and poor White and Black people.\r\r- Asian women are submissive, subservient, sex craving, etc. Asian men are dominating, patriarchal, sexist etc: False! Asian women are given a lot of respect and power by Asian men. Asian women can also be materialistic, agressive and dominating (ask any man who has dated an Asian). Many Asian countries treat women as equals and many women keep their surnames. In Asian culture, it is generally accepted that the man does the talking in public and act gentlemanly, whilst the woman has control at home. In Western culture, it is the opposite. Caucasian women are given the impression of power in public, but is often told that the kitchen is her place at home. \"A man's home is his castle\" is a Western saying. \"Women hold up half the heavens\" is Asian. There have been no female presidents, but there have been female emperors in Asia.\r\r- All Asians are \"blah\": False. Half the world's population is Asian.

Depending on how [ghetto] she thinks she is, she may wear oversized men's t-shirts with tight, usually white Brazilian pants, with a colored thong worn underneath that shows through (on purpose).

The greatest concentrations of hipsters can be found living in the Williamsburg, Wicker Park, and Mission District neighborhoods of major cosmopolitan centers such as New York, Chicago, and San Francisco respectively.  Although \"hipsterism\" is really a state of mind,it is also often intertwined with distinct fashion sensibilities. Hipsters reject the culturally-ignorant attitudes of mainstream consumers, and are often be seen wearing vintage and thrift store inspired fashions, tight-fitting jeans, old-school sneakers, and sometimes thick rimmed glasses.  Both hipster men and women sport similar androgynous hair styles that include combinations of messy shag cuts and asymmetric side-swept bangs.  Such styles are often associated with the work of creative stylists at urban salons, and are usually too \"edgy\" for the culturally-sheltered mainstream consumer.  The \"effortless cool\" urban bohemian look of a hipster is exemplified in Urban Outfitters and American Apparel ads which cater towards the hipster demographic. Despite misconceptions based on their aesthetic tastes, hipsters tend to be well educated and often have liberal arts degrees, or degrees in maths and sciences, which also require certain creative analytical thinking abilities.  Consequently many hipsters tend to have jobs in the music, art, and fashion industries.  It is a myth that most hipsters are unemployed and live off of their parent's trust funds.   \r\n\r\n     Hipsters shun mainstream societal conventions that apply to dating preferences and traditional \"rules\" of physical attraction.  It is part of the hipster central dogma not to be influenced by mainsream advertising and media, which tends to only promote ethnocentric ideals of beauty.  The concepts of androgyny and feminism have influenced hipster culture, where hipster men are often as thin as the women they date. The muscular and athletic all-American male ideal is not seen as attractive by confident and culturally-empowered hipster women who instead view them as symbols of male oppression, sexism, and misogyny.  Likewise, culturally-vapid sorority-type girls with fake blond hair, overly tanned skin, and \"Britney Spears tube-tops\" are not seen as attractive by cultured hipster males who instead see them as symbols of female insecurity, low self-esteem, and lack of cultural intelligence and independent thinking.  Hipsters are also very racially open-minded, and the greatest number of interracial couples in any urban environment are typically found within the hipster subculture.  \r\n\r\n     Although hipsters are technically conformists within their own subculture, in comparison to the much larger mainstream mass, they are pioneers and leaders of the latest cultural trends and ideals.  For example, the surge of jeans made to look old and worn (i.e. \"distressed\"), that have become prevalent at stores such as The Gap, American Eagle, Abercrombie and Fitch, and Hollister, were originally paraded by hipsters who shopped in thrift stores years before such clothing items were mass produced and sold to the mainstream consumer.  The true irony here is that many of the detractors of hipster culture are in fact unknowingly following a path that hipsters have carved out years before them.  This phenomena also applies to music as well, as many bands have become successful and known to mainstream audiences only because hipsters first found and listened to them as early-adopters of new culture.  Once certain concepts of fashion and music have reached mainstream audiences, hipsters move on to something new and improved.\r\n\r\n     Because of the rise of various online photo-blog and social networking sites, insights into urban hipster culture is reaching sheltered suburban audiences at an exponential rate.  Cultural \"norms\" have been deconstructed by hipster culture as a whole. Hipsterism is often dismissed as just an image thing by some, but the culture as a whole is effecting changes in society, leading to feelings of insecurity and resentment in people who are no longer a part of the cultural ruling class. For example, a lot of anti-hipster sentiment evidently comes from culturally-clueless suburban frat boy types who feel that the more sensitive, intelligent, and culturally aware hipster ideal threatens their insecure sense of masculinity.  Anti-hipster sentiment often comes from people who simply can't keep up with social change and are envious of those who can.", "gender": "male", "word": "hipster", "tags": ["urban-dic"]}, {"definition": "fine-ass,dick-sucking,cock-loving females.", "gender": "male", "word": "hoes", "tags": ["urban-dic"]}, {"definition": "1.

A person who lacks belief in a [god] or gods.  People who use this definition categorize atheists as either negative (or implicit or weak) atheists or positive (or explicit or strong) atheists.  Negative atheists, while they don't believe in a god, do not positively assert that no gods exist.  Positive atheists, however, do.\r\r\r\r2.)

In both cases, this seems to be a demagogic practice intended to classify either as many or as few people as atheists as possible.  Negative atheists are usually referred to as [agnostic]s.\r\r\r\rWhile neither definition of atheism entails any personality traits of atheists or of those who do believe in a god or gods (sometimes referred to as '[theist]s'), both atheists and theists tend to believe that certain traits apply to all atheists/theists.  Common myths about atheists include: all atheists are arrogant, immoral, rebellious, and/or intolerant; all atheists really believe in (the Christian) God and are simply in denial; all atheists are depressed and believe life is meaningless.  Common myths about theists include: all theists are naive and/or intolerant; all theists don't really believe in their god(s) and just pretend to because they're afraid that if people realised that no god exists, there will be complete chaos; all theists are weak and look to their god(s) for comfort.  It hardly needs to be said that while these myths apply to a select few individuals in each group, the claim that they apply to every atheist or every theist is false.\r\r\r\rNegative atheists justify their lack of belief in god(s) by pointing out that no evidence exists for the existence of god(s), and justify their lack of disbelief by pointing out that no evidence exists for the nonexistence thereof.  Positive atheists often assert that while no evidence for god(s) exists, it should be by default assumed that they do not, until evidence is found.  Some also try to use [logic] to prove that God does not exist, but this is often attached by theists and weak atheists as being mere wordplay.  Some theists and weak atheists also assert that logic is superficial and meaningless (which is an easily refutable claim), and that only one's inner feelings can lead them to truth.  Some positive atheists (and [deist]s), however, are led to their stance through their feelings.  Some feel that because the world is filled with evil and malice, and all-loving, benevolent god cannot exist.  Those who are led to their stance through this feeling, however, cannot justify their disbelief in a malevolent god in the same way.  Some reject the idea of the Christian God because the [Bible] states that non-Christians are condemned to [Hell], and reject the idea as being too disturbing.

The Government is supreme and the country is all-encompasing, and all within it must conform to the ruling body, often a dictator.\r\n\r\n2.\"Nothing outside the state\".  The country must grow and the implied goal of any fascist nation is to rule the world, and have every human submit to the government.\r\n\r\n3.\"Nothing against the state\".  Any type of questioning the government is not to be tolerated.  If you do not see things our way, you are wrong.  If you do not agree with the government, you cannot be allowed to live and taint the minds of the rest of the good citizens.\r\n\r\nThe use of militarism was implied only as a means to accomplish one of the three above principles, mainly to keep the people and rest of the world in line.

Someone who believes in a totalitarian state rule by a supreme leader (dictator) who controls everything possible and treats people harshly -- to gain the leader's own success,* to foment an aggressive military nationalism, and to promote a Social Darwinist belief that hard life strengthens the state by weeding out the weak. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. A lesser authority (corporation, mayor, cop, boss, parent) who legally issues harsh, burdensome, micro-managing, insensitive, or uncaring orders -- especially when they know, or should know, that their goals can be accomplished with more autonomy and much less hardship or distress. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. A harsh and probably murderous kind of dictator; a \"fascist dictator\" as opposed to a \"benign dictator\".  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. If applied unfairly, a parent authority who is doing their job within reason, but their teen either doesn't agree with their agenda (10 PM curfew to help perform well in morning school), or is insincerely asserting their parent to be a harsh disciplinarian, in order to bond socially with friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. If capitalized, is the name of the historic Italian Fascist political party. Benito Mussolini (Il Duce - \"The Leader\") was the Fascist founder and Prime Minister from 1922 to 1943, who built a cult of personality around himself using false media propaganda that he was always right, killed those relatively few unbrainwashed who opposed him, and unified Italy for an incompetent war to retake much of the old Roman empire. Apologists encapsulated their approval of his social control-freakery in the saying, \"Il Duce made the trains run on time\". \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"fascist\" connotates an official form of antisocial behavior, if society is understood to have valid comfort needs not met by a harsh authoritarian work ethic or supervision style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"fascist\" has general application to the misuse of hierarchical power in government, business, and religion, as well as to all other levels of society.  As the global population increases, it will continue as one of the future's most important social issues. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"fascist\" behavior can be observed in some form in everyday life, but is especially obvious on TV when ordered by right-wing politicians, mean bosses, and greedy corporations. Parents can be both fairly or unfairly labeled, because some parents are minor fascists, yet teens can't always tell what is fascist over-control, from what is just good parenting. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNear-synonyms: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany folks should have said \"fascist\", if they misused \"nazi\" in poor taste, since the latter is properly reserved for genocide and extermination concerns only. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"fascist\" is different from \"racist\", though racists are often fascists as well. But there are several nation-state military examples where the races have worked together to control the population in arguably fascist or at least military styles. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnwary citizens can be duped by two-faced \"cryptofascist\" policies. For example, people in a dangerous neighborhood might accept a policy of police searching all houses for weapons. But the real purpose of the searches might be to locate books supporting the political opposition, and to intimidate or arrest people found nearby.

Hinduism does promise, however, a different form of \"eternal bliss\" and end to suffering. (explained below)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHinduism has many holy texts, but the most sacred are the Vedas and Upinashads. The Bhagavad Gita, a section of the epic Mahabarata, is sometimes referred to as the \"Hindu Bible\" because in this text the Lord Krishna relays the major points of the Hindu faith to Arjuna, a warrior hero. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe major beliefs of Hindus include reincarnation, karma (the belief that actions in this life will contribute to the quality of the next life. good actions yield good results, bad yields bad), and ahimsa (nonviolence to all living things). Ahimsa will help one attain good karma, which in turn will help him/her achieve a higher quality next life. The ultimate goal of the Hindu is to achieve moksha, or union with the eternal soul, Brahman. (since the ultimate goal is a union with THE eternal soul, Hinduism is fundamentally \"monotheistic,\" the visible manifestations of God such as Vishnu and Shiva are representations of Brahman, so that the human mind can comprehend it). Union with the eternal soul can be attained through meditation and yogic practices or dedication and devotion to one's duty. Because of this need for dedication to duty, the caste system was created by Krishna to keep people focusing on their jobs; HUMANS (not God) corrupted the system and discriminated against people of \"lower\" castes. Hinduism also urges people to be dispassionate because attachment to worldly objects is superficial and leads only to suffering. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToday, Hinduism is practiced mainly in India and Nepal, though it is spread throughout the world including the U.K., some countries in Africa, South America, and of course in the U.S.A.", "gender": "female", "word": "Hinduism", "tags": ["urban-dic"]}, {"definition": "A Hippie is a person who was raised under the ideological system that came out of the tumultuous 1960's in North America and western Europe.

They are treacherous, best not to trust them. The aggression level is so high that they can't get on without killing each other, every excuse is good to start a military conflict, or at least humiliate the opposing side and show one's domination over the other side.

All in all, they have a tendency for over expression of their feelings, yet sometimes they seem to have no real feelings at all or have extremely shallow feelings.

A difference between what you expect to happen (in a story, for example) and what actually happens.  Rain on your wedding day would be a sort-of example, because a wedding day is generally expected to be a perfect, happy day.

We could say the word itself has gained a more general and complex meaning since its migration from Sicily to USA.\r\n\r\nAs regards the word itself: its origin can be traced back in the centuries. Sure it had something to do with the many invasions Sicily was exposed to. During the ages, Sicily has been invaded by pretty much ALL of the peoples in the Mediterranean Area: Greeks, Romans, Normands (~French), Arabs, Spanish, Italians nowadays. This gave the island's culture an inmense richness, but as a side effect created among Sicilians some sort of silent \"brotherhood\" against anyone coming from the outside world.\r\n\r\nThis \"brotherhood\", meaning protection of the masses from the invasors, lately degenerated into an oppression of the masses.

Dopamine is released in the brain naturally when people eat, drink and have sex. 1 Dopamine is released into the synaptic space in between the pre and postsynaptic neurons. Here is where speed comes in. Speed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal (Speed doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have a goal it merely exists, but this is the reason people use it) is to trigger a buildup of Dopamine. Speed first enters the Terminal Button in one of several ways. Speed is very similar on a molecular level to Dopamine so Speed can enter the Dopamine transporter or speed can diffuse into the neuron. The amphetamine then expels the dopamine out into the synaptic space. It does this through a process that forces the Dopamine transporters to go in reverse. Under natural circumstances Dopamine is brought back into the terminal button through the Dopamine reuptake pumps. These pumps do not work as well when speed is present in the brain and the Dopamine remains longer as a result. \u00e2\u0080\u009c[Speed also] inhibit[s] monoamine oxydase A (MAO-A).\u00e2\u0080\u009d1 Speed also forces glutamate to come into the synaptic space. The result of this is dopamine will flow more easily. \r\n\tThe effects people notice with amphetamines make it clear why the drug has earned the name speed. Speed makes everything go faster. When on the drug, which can be taken in forms of powder, pills and injections, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour heart rate\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 blood pressure and movements all increase [in speed].\u00e2\u0080\u009d 2 It also makes sleep difficult.  The size of the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pupils increase and weight loss becomes easier. While the user is \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh\u00e2\u0080\u009d off the drug he or she can expect \u00e2\u0080\u009cto feel good, [be more willing to] take risks and be excited\u00e2\u0080\u009d.2 Speed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-term effects are for the most part similar to many other drugs. Speed causes depression, personal problems, anger and violence. Speed is also addicting. There is one more side effect that is more unique to the drug. This side effect is coined psychosis. Psychosis is a serious psychological problem. People that suffer from it hear voices in their head, become delusional and paranoid. Psychosis victims are known to see things that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there and often feel that ordinary objects and people want to hurt them.4.

When she becomes addicted she believes her refrigerator is trying to kill her.3 Amphetamines although possibly more enjoyable then other drugs also negatively affect you sooner. 3 Fevers, heart attacks and death are all possible results of the use of speed.2", "gender": "male", "word": "speed", "tags": ["urban-dic"]}, {"definition": "Spirit; pluck.
