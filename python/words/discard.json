Note: Do not confuse this with a much broader range of stupid looking, messy on purpose hair, usually belonging to a [scenester].\r\n\r\n1b. If the hair is not ridiculously greasy and/or black, the hair is preened in some ridiculously outdated and hideous style, that, again, must cover at least 60% of the face.\r\n\r\n2. Girl's jeans. My personal theory is that they wear these pants to accentuate their genitalia, but as we all know that emo fags never have any use for their genitalia\r\n\r\n3a. A very tight argyle sweater, even in the summer time.\r\n\r\n3b. A very tight T-shirt, maybe a girl's \"babydoll\" T-shirt, usually adorned with a picture of a band that is very hard to listen to.\r\n\r\n4. Extreme skinniness, not natural thinness, but more of an emaciated form, almost as if they are too sad to eat.\r\n\r\n5. An uncomfortable looking scarf, even in hot weather. Usually in some ironic, plaid or striped pattern.\r\n\r\n6. (Optional) Trite box-frame glasses, used to make said emo fag look intellectual. In many cases, these glasses are non-prescription. If in any event you discover that an emo fag you see is wearing glasses they do not need, it is policy to grab and destroy these, preferrably in  front of him and his emo fag friends.\r\n\r\n7. Converse All-Star shoes, mainly black (and sometimes they will spend extra money to get the kind with black rubber), but some presistent emo fags will go out of their way to purchase this style of shoe in some garish pastel color off the Internet. They will 9 times out of 10 be in pristine condition (due to having 15 pairs), save for some Sharpie markings, usually some band name, or ridiculous lyrics.\r\n\r\n8. A black leather belt with some form of metal stud worn around the beltline, but stupidly enough not threaded through the belt loops.\r\n\r\n9. (Optional) Cliche tattoos/piercings, including a Cal Star (aka Nautical Star), lobe plugs (usually not ridiculously big like those body mod freakshows who don't like dealing with that pesky job market), barbed wire. Note: Some emo fags are too young to get piercings or tattoos, so they just tell everyone about what they're going to get.

Like everyone else, it all falls under personal preference. Sex is really such a personal and intimate act that no one answer would fit for everyone, but here are a few particulars to consider ... \r\n\r\nBODIES. We sometimes forget that the entire body is an erogenous zone. Sensitive areas include the face, ears, neck, arms, chest, belly, back, butt, and thighs, back of knees, calves, feet and toes. The entire body can be used to excite a woman. Rubbing bodies together, feeling erect nipples or moist pubic area can excite with subtle motions. \r\n\r\nFINGERS. Fingers can be delightful to use on those women who enjoy penetration (not all women do). Some women appreciate long, thin fingers while others like the feel of short, strong fingers. No matter what the preference, all women appreciate clean, short, well-filed nails. \r\n\r\nHANDS. Running hands up and down a lover's body will often elicit electric responses of passion. From light caresses down the back to deep rubbing across the butt, caressing is an important aspect to sex. Caressing often turns to gentle pinching or tugging at nipples. Lightly running fingers in a tickling motion across the belly and sides will excite many women. Once excitement has built, slipping fingers into the vagina or rubbing against the clitoris will often bring a woman to orgasm. \r\n\r\nMOUTH. Kissing is a good place to begin and a very important part of sex. Kisses come in different styles depending on the person, the mood and the moment. Tiny, soft kisses tantalize and intrigue. Deep, open-mouth kisses with tongues entwined convey a depth of passion and longing. Kisses are appropriate for any part of the body, wherever one feels the urge to place them, lightly or with trailing tongues. Gently nibbling or sucking on nipples excites some women, and some women can reach orgasm just from breast arousal. It is important to note reactions to these stimulations as some women dislike having their breasts touched at all. Gently nibbling or sucking on a responsive clitoris is enjoyed by most women and most often results in orgasm.\r\n\r\nPELVIC AREA. Some women can reach orgasm by rubbing pelvic areas together or against a lover's leg. This can be done with one partner on top or two women side-to-side.\r\n\r\nANAL SEX. Anal sex can include anilingus (licking the anus) and/or penetration. Penetration can be done with a finger or fingers, dildo or butt plug. Some women love anal sex, others do not. Like everything else, it's all personal preference. \r\n\r\nDILDOS, VIBRATORS & BUTT PLUGS. (Or objects used to vaginal or anal penetration). Some women use dildos and/or butt plugs some do not. Some use them occasionally; some use them all the time. Dildos come in many different shapes, colors and sizes. Some are shaped as corncobs, fists, dolphins or fingers. Some have attachments to stimulate the clitoris during penetration and some have two ends to stimulate two women at one time. It's all personal preference. \r\n\r\nFISTING. Fisting is penetrating a woman's vagina with your entire hand. Fisting requires a lot of concentration and caution. I recommend Hand In The Bush: The Fine Art of Vaginal Fisting, by Deborah Addington, if you want to learn the proper how-to on fisting. \r\n\r\nMUTUAL MASTURBATION.

For a girl, you are required to wait 10 minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10 scale.\r\n\r\n8. Bitching about the brand of free beverages in your buddy's refrigerator is forbidden. But gripe at will if the temperature is not suitable.\r\n\r\n9.

You must offer heartfelt condolences over the death of a girlfriends cat, even if it was you who secretly set it on fire and threw it into a ceiling fan.\r\n\r\n18.

Only in a situation of mortal danger or ass peril are you permitted to kick another member of the male species in the testicles.\r\n\r\n23. Unless you're in prison, never fight naked.

However, \"house rules\" may come into effect, in which case it is left up to the owner of the seat.\r\n\r\n26. Shotgun can be called on anything where a shotgun applies., as long as you are in eyesight of the object, or it is at a reasonable time.\r\n\r\n27. When picking players for sports teams it is permissible to skip over your buddy in favor of better athletes- as long as you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let him be the last sorry son of a bitch standing on the sideline.\r\n\r\n28.

The only time dicking over a buddy for a girl is legal, is when the girl ranks a 8 or above on the 1-10 scale. (exception: a girl may rank from 5-7, as long as there is oral sex involved).\r\n\r\n44.

A man's shoes may not intentionally match any other article of clothing on his body.\r\n\r\n55. No comment shall ever be made to a man about how much he is sweating.

A female [fanfiction] character who is so perfect as to be annoying. The male equivlalent is the [Marty-Stu]. Often abbreviated to \"Sue\". A Mary Sue character is usually written by a beginning author. Often, the Mary Sue is a self-insert with a few \"improvements\" (ex. better body, more popular, etc). The Mary Sue character is almost always beautiful, smart, etc... In short, she is the \"perfect\" girl. The Mary Sue usually falls in love with the author's favorite character(s) and winds up upstaging all of the other characters in the book/series/universe. There are several main types of Mary Sue: \r\n\r\nVictim!Sues: The Victim!Sue is your whiny, wimpy, pathetic female character who can't seem to do much of anything except cry and get herself into trouble that the romantic interest of the fic has to rescue her from. \r\n\r\nWarrior!Sues: The Warrior!Sue is usually loud, obnoxious and (of course) an amazing warrior. She'll usually have some tragic past that led her to become a warrior, and she'll upstage all of the [Canonical] characters with her mad Sueish powerz. \r\n\r\nMage!Sue: Similar to the Warrior!Sue, the Mage!Sue has amazing stregnth in magic, or has a magical power that nobody else has. She'll usually wind up upstaging all of the magical characters of the series.\r\n\r\nPunk!Sue: Also called Noncomformist!Sue or Goth!Sue, the Punk!Sue is usually written by female beginners in the 11-15 age group. The Punk!Sue is loud, obnoxious, annoying and generally the type of person who you'd want to send off to boot camp for six months. The Punk!Sue almost always has angst coming out of her ears and isn't really a bad person, she's just oh!-so-angry at whatever tragic past the author has chosen to give her. The Punk!Sue is based on what the 11-15 year old author thinks is \"cool\" and wishes she could be. This includes Evil!Sues.\r\n\r\nMisfit!Sue: This includes all Sues who are supposedly geeks, nerds, misfits, etc. Usually, the Misfit!Sue doesn't start out as inhumanly beautiful, but winds up getting a makeover and finding out she had the potential to be a guy-magnet (or girl-magnet, depending on the genre) all along. Also includes the \"My parents want me to do this but I want to do that and it's not fair!!one!\" type of Sue. Usually, this Sue is very bookish and smart, but will find some sort of physical talent nobody expected and become a star as a result.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note is that a Sue will usually have a completely off-the-wall name, like \"Viquetoria\". The more wierd and pretentious the name of the character, the more likely it is that she's a Sue.\r\n\r\nFinally, Sues often have wierd, improbable or impossible bloodlines.

The outcome was that they admitted they had gone too far to appease the feminist point of view and had to review their courses material to ensure they were more balanced.\r\nI am not saying I invented they word but I was probably one of many men who were of the same opinion at the time.

Texas State hosts the kids you loathed in high school. We had the nicest cars, parents money, and the nicest bodies. It's not our fault that we would like to congregate at the same school and bask in our awesomeness. Are we vain? Shallow? Fuck yeah we are, and we have the absolute right to be. You may hate us because we party harder, rock tighter bodies, and will STILL get better jobs than you because even if we're here for six years, we can network like the fucking best.\n\nHave any doubts? Other universities TRAVEL to party with our school's elite. River Raft Race in one of the biggest parties nationally, with over 2,000 participants this past year alone. People come from Arizona, Colorado, New Jersey, and even California to see what the fuck we're about for just one weekend.\n\nStill hate our school?

We turn the state capital into our own personal Vegas every weekend, and nobody stands in our way.

Coach bags are our gym bags, and you'll be laughed out if you think Sperry's are expensive shoes.\n\nWhy do we get the greatest jobs?

It's not their fault, how can you compete with a school that's the perfect mesh of street smarts, great looks, and trust funds?\n\nPartying is just part of our nature. We have a fucking BAR in the student center on campus. The only reason you hate is because WE are living the American dream. We toke, roll, yay it out all day because we can and still rape a good GPA.\n\nYou think we're immature and don't want to grow up? Why? Because our parents pay for everything? You're right, it crazy of us to take advantage of the BMWs, boats, Range Rovers, shopping allowances and free trips to Miami and Vegas. Sorry our parents don't want us to work at McDonalds and live on loans. We're not immature, we're spoiled, gifted really, and fuck yeah we're going to enjoy the ride. Maybe if you lost a few pounds and got a tan, we'd let you come along too.\n\nAnd forget about the freshman fifteen, we don't tolerate that here. If you're not a gym rat, just pack your bags. We only socialize with the hottest, and that takes maintenance. So we tan, we work out, we dye, we bleach. You say our girls look like Playboy models?

For some reason, part of the Keywork comes loose, threatening a cataclysmic disaster for the universe. Coheed and Cambria are \"Guardians of the Keywork\" and Coheed is sent to a distant planet to repair the damage. Apparently, Coheed is the only person capable of doing this.\r\r\r\rUnfortunately, someone has injected a serum, called the 'Monstar virus,' into Coheed's body. Once activated, the Monstar leads to a disaster of apocolyptic proportions for mankind. However, the Monstar can only be activated by introducing a liquid called 'the ciache' into the host's bloodstream, and then making eye contact with the trigger counterpart (presumably, Cambria). Coheed has passed a form of the virus, known as the Sinstar virus, onto his four children: Josephine, Claudio, Matthew, and Mariah. The Sinstar virus will destroy the universe if activated, and is activated by a host reaching their 23rd birthday. The Sinstar also has no cure (unlike the Monstar). A general named Mayo Deftinwolf relays this information on to Coheed and urges him to kill his four children before the Sinstar takes effect.\r\r\r\rCoheed succeeds in this mission by poisioning Matthew and Mariah, and doing away with Josephine as well. However, Claudio somehow survives, and now has the charge of saving the universe from the Monstar, which has been activated in Coheed. Coheed and Cambria are now dead, as the Monstar has taken over Coheed's body. Cambria's cause of death has not been revealed as of yet.\r\r\r\rMeanwhile, a huge war has broken out on Earth. The war may or may not be related to the Keywork's problems, but things aren't looking too good. Claudio tells the story of his love for Newo Ikkin, and his defection from the army to be with her. Claudio then boards a spacecraft called the Velorium Camper, which is piloted by a psychotic killer named Al.

(It is a nice [pipe dream] but human nature will forever stand in the way of that goal).\r\n\r\nMost libtards subscribe to the notion that \"people are basically good\", and build their foundation for activism and \"improving the human condition\" on that faulty premise. Because they deny the facts about human nature, their \"reasoning\" is diametrically opposite to common sense (blue states vs. red states).\r\n\r\nThe reality that people have different initiative levels, are basically selfish, and often work for their own interests before helping others, puts a libtard's [panties in a wad]. So, when citizens will not voluntarily comply with various libtard prescriptions for \"the common good\", then laws must be passed, or force used, to MAKE them comply. (It is the gradual path to totalitarianism).\r\n\r\nLikewise, his/her na\u00c3\u00afve cries of: \"can't we all just get along?\" and \"there is nothing worth dying for\" are red flags for anyone with a clue.\r\n\r\nMetaphorically speaking, a libtard is a sheep who thinks that their grasp of diplomatic nuance or metaphysical sensitivity will prevent their flock from being devoured by the world's Islamic/Communist wolves. When America, the sheep dog, responds to wolf attacks, the libtard judges these defensive actions as offensive and wolfish.\r\n\r\nSince libtards are unable to recognize our enemies for what they are, they cannot be trusted to safeguard our future.\r\n\r\n>>>>>\r\n\r\nIn a large nutshell, a libtard's goal in life includes one or more of the following:\r\n\r\n--the establishment of a Socialist \"utopia\" (a.k.a. a global [nanny state])\r\n--\"benevolent\" totalitarian control of the world's population through any means necessary\r\n--ever increasing government micromanagement of private enterprise (a.k.a. clueless meddling)\r\n--the adoption of laws, treaties and tax regulations that hinder America's competitiveness\r\n--the usurpation of the legislative process, at all levels, through judicial fiat\r\n--the filing of specious law suits in order to thwart the will of the people (e.g. Calif. Proposition. 187)\r\n--the promotion of the tyranny of the minority\r\n--the filing of specious law suits to shakedown corporations for cash (under the guise of \"social responsibility\")\r\n--the disproportionate taxation of citizens \"who have more money than they need\"\r\n--the redistribution of wealth from producers to non-producers (under the guise of \"fairness\")\r\n--the banning and confiscation of all privately owned guns (even though it has lead to genocide)\r\n--the abolition of all private property rights\r\n--the destruction of all national sovereignty (America first, of course)\r\n--the destruction of Capitalism\r\n--the establishment of one religion (with no personal accountability), OR the abolition of all religion\r\n--the appeasement of Islamic radicals and their American front groups like CAIR (see: [Religion of Pieces])\r\n--the regulation, or banning, of all opposition media (under the guise of \"fairness\")\r\n--the appeasement of Communist dictators and their American front groups\r\n--the further insertion of Socialist ideology and indoctrination into public school curricula\r\n--the purposeful \"dumbing down\" of the masses through inane public school curricula and pedagogy\r\n--mass thought control through \"speech codes\" and [political correctness]\r\n--the further promulgation of the homosexual/pedophile agenda\r\n--the teaching of HATE (superficially disguised as \"Women's Studies\", \"African Studies\", etc.)\r\n--the legalization of marijuana (\"far OUT, man\")\r\n--the establishment of world wide socialized medicine (under the guise of \"fairness\")\r\n--the conservation of the environment over the conservation of the American economy\r\n--the demonization of attempts to make English America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national language\r\n--world peace (which genocidal dictators define as: \"the absence of conflict\"--dead men cannot resist your brutal oppression)\r\n--the conservation of the environment over the conservation of humanity\r\n--the promotion of abortion as birth control, eugenics, and teaching the theory of evolution as fact (even though the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics precludes it from the get-go)\r\n--the abolition of individual freedom\r\n--anarchy\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, there is a thread of anti-Americanism that runs through these ideas. A libtard cannot stomach the idea that America, despite its faults, is the greatest country in the world. As such, he/she sees it as their duty to tarnish the country's current and past image using all available means including: cherry picking facts and using innuendo, half-truths, lies and fabrications (see: [Rathergate]).\r\n\r\nLibtards\u00e2\u0080\u0099 actions undermine America's educational system, economy, criminal justice system, military personnel, sovereignty, security, and freedoms. Meanwhile, they try to fabricate a moral equivalence with rogue nations like China, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Syria, Somalia and Sudan. (But don't question their patriotism).\r\n\r\nNOTE TO ALL MALCONTENTS: If America is truly evil, please pick yourself a better country.\r\n\r\nIf the health care system in Cuba, Canada or Great Britain is superior to America's, then you are free to leave. If the crime rate in China, North Korea or the [Magic Kingdom] is so much lower, then you too are free to leave. Not enough hedonism for you? Then try Amsterdam, Bangkok or Tijuana.\r\n\r\nIf life in general is better in Sweden, The Netherlands or Switzerland then WHY are you still here??? You talk big, but you lack the courage of your convictions. So do humanity a favor--shut up and move away.\r\n\r\nOtherwise get a real job, and get a life, because you obviously have WAY too much time on your hands.\r\n\r\n>>>>>\r\n\r\nBecause most libtards are pantheists (New Agers), agnostics, atheists, liberal Jews, liberal Catholics, or have otherwise turned their backs on Jehovah, they lack true spiritual fulfillment. In order to try and fill that void, and \"to make a difference\", they work for the causes listed above. A pretty complete listing can be found at discoverthenetworks.org.\r\n\r\nA libtard will participate in protests, rallies, marches, bike rides, etc. in a feckless attempt to change whatever supposedly needs changing (see: [muckadoo]). Their desire to revisit the \"glory\" days of the 60's is sometimes a driving force. Regardless, the end result is usually the same: nothing actually changes.\r\n\r\nBut, since a libtard wants to be rated for his/her good intentions, versus actual results, they leave these activities with a feeling of success \"because they have raised awareness\" or \"let their voices be heard.\" Post-protest gatherings often feature excessive drinking, drug abuse, and impromptu fornication to celebrate the \"victory.\" \r\n\r\nBecause conservatives take responsibility for themselves and their children, have real jobs, under gird the economy, and value their time, their counter protesting is often negligible.\r\n\r\nIt is not that they don't care about their causes; they just understand that 1968 tactics are useless. Likewise, their sense of self worth does not come from how well they perform at work, or in life, but from a realization that they have been given a good and satisfying destiny that no one can take away.\r\n\r\nWith all of this in mind, may we NOW question a libtard's patriotism???", "gender": "male", "word": "Libtard", "tags": ["urban-dic"]}, {"definition": "When one gets many more likes/retweets/favorites on a social networking site than usual.", "gender": "male", "word": "Like shock", "tags": ["urban-dic"]}, {"definition": "Liking your own post or comment on Facebook.", "gender": "male", "word": "liketurbate", "tags": ["urban-dic"]}, {"definition": "Ok since everyone is just posting OPINIONS.

It most frequently comes in tablet form, although it is occasionally sold in capsules or as powder. It is most frequently used orally and rarely snorted. MDMA use is closely tied to the underground rave (and dance club) scene throughout the world, but has also been widely used by therapists as an adjunct to psychotherapy. \r\n\r\nBecause MDMA is so popular and because it goes well with dance parties, the demand for it usually exceeds supply--especially at any given location on any given night. This creates an opening for unscrupulous individuals to sell virtually anything as 'ecstasy'. While 'ecstasy' is the popular name for MDMA, the functional definition of ecstasy is any pill represented as MDMA on the street. Ecstasy pills are notoriously unreliable in content, more so than most other street drugs, and commonly contain either caffeine, ephedrine, amphetamines, MDA, MDE, DXM, or--in rare cases--DOB, and don't necessarily contain MDMA or any psychoactive. This problem has led to the development of simple MDMA testing kits that may help give the user a general sense of the content of a pill.\r\n\r\nDose\r\nA standard oral dose of MDMA is between 80 - 150 mg. Most good quality pills contain somewhere in this range, generally 80-120 mg. A large percentage of users find that, unlike with many other psychoactives such as LSD or mushrooms, there is a 'sweet spot' in MDMA dosage. Once this spot is found, higher dosages are not particularly desirable as they don't increase the sought after effects or duration.\r\n\r\nPrice\r\nThe price of MDMA varies wildly depending on where it's purchased and in what quantity. A single tablet bought at a rave can cost as much as $50 though more commonly $20-$30. Purchased in higher quantities MDMA generally sells for $100-$250 per gram (about $10-25 per dose), with wholesale prices as low as $50 per gram.\r\n\r\nLaw\r\nMDMA is illegal in the United States (Schedule I) and in most other countries. It is also listed as Schedule I in the International Convention on Psychotropic Substances, an international drug control treaty. \r\n\r\nChemistry\r\n3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine (MDMA) is a synthetic chemical that can be derived from an essential oil of the sassafras tree.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nMDMA was first synthesized and patented by Merck pharmaceuticals in 1912 and patented in 1914, but it wasn't until the mid 1970s that articles related to its psychoactivity began showing up in scholarly journals. In the late '70s and early '80s MDMA was used as a psychotherapeutic tool and also started to become available on the street. Its growing popularity led to it being made illegal in the United States in 1985 and its popularity has continued to increase since then.\r\n\r\nSlang\r\nThe Substance : [MDMA], [ecstasy], [X], [XTC], [E], M, adam, [bean], [roll],\r\n\r\nThe Experience : X-ing, [rolling], [tripping], [wigging]\r\n\r\nOnset\r\nDepending on how much and how recently one has eaten, MDMA generally takes 30-60 minutes (although sometimes as long as 2 hours) to take effect. Unlike with many other psychoactives, the onset of MDMA is very quick. Often at the point one realizes that perhaps they are starting to notice effects, they are already 'launching' quickly towards the peak. This quick and extremely sharp 'launch' can be unnerving, feeling a bit like it's too quick and hard to know when it's going to end, but the feeling generally only lasts a few minutes until the full effects are reached\r\n\r\nDuration\r\nThe primary effects of MDMA last approximately 3-4 hours when taken orally. For many people there is an additional period of time (2-6 hrs) where it is difficult to go to sleep and there is definitely a noticeable difference from everyday reality, but which is not strong enough to be considered 'tripping'. Many people also experience a noticeable shift in mood for several days after use; for some this is a period of depression while others experience lifted mood.\r\n\r\nThe Experience\r\nWhen the full effects of MDMA manifest, barring an uncommon negative reaction, users are likely to find that suddenly everything is right with the world. The primary effects sought by those using MDMA recreationally are the emotional openness, euphoria, stimulation, reduction of critical and cynical thoughts, and decrease of inhibitions that can accompany its use. MDMA is used by some individuals in a therapeutic setting to attempt to work through difficult interpersonal issues. Although MDMA can cause nystagmus (eye wiggles), most individuals experience few prominent open or closed eye visuals. A small percentage of users report significant visual distortions.", "gender": "male", "word": "mdma", "tags": ["urban-dic"]}, {"definition": "A person who eats meat virtually to the exclusion of vegetables.

His \"Ricks College\" t-shirt is a dead give away. Ricks College is a Mormon school, (now called BYU Idaho).

The Boy Scout program is almost single-handedly run by the Mormon (LDS) Church in the west, and is a very significant part of their development program for boys. The director and his co-writer wife are Mormon, so is the actor who plays Napoleon. Most of the cast/crew are from Brigham Young University, (BYU)and most of the cool words that Napoleon uses like flip and gosh have been used by Mormon kids for decades. \r\n\r\nEven the liger has roots in growing up in the Mormon west...the liger was a real half-lion half-tiger that actually lived for many years at the Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City, and is well known to legions of Mormon kids who went to Hogle Zoo on field trips. After it died it was stuffed and mounted and is still on display at the zoo. \r\n\r\nThough no-fault of the director, (the film is loosely based on his life in Preston) much of the deeply subtle humor in the movie is only caught by those familiar with Mormon culture.

Many narutards dress as their favorite character during conventions or festivals to display their metal head bands, which are worn by characters in the series as a sign of gang affiliation. One characteristic of a narutard is that they will wear just a head band over their street clothes and tell everyone that they are cosplaying. Serious cosplayers who wear costumes that cost hundreds of dollars in raw materials and took weeks to construct generally consider narutards to be anywhere from merely ignorant to downright insulting.\r\n\r\nWith the license acquisition of Naruto in early 2005 by ShoPro Entertainment, many narutards spawned numerous forum discussions debating the impact of the deal, from the legality of trafficking amateur subtitled copies of the title (something which should be pretty obvious, especially once American distribution rights had been acquired) to a grass-roots petition begging Cartoon Network and ShoPro / Viz to retain the full integrity of the anime during its adaptation into English. However, as with many Japanese series adapted into English, there are legal and other issues which often make it difficult if not impossible to produce a rendition faithful enough to appease purists.\r\n\r\nMost narutards are, unsurprisingly, also purists when it comes to adapting Naruto into English.

The term rolling deep stems directly from the world of hardcore hip hop and gangsta rap, and is often used in conjunction with phrases like, \"Ya best proteck ya neck,\" \"bakdafukup,\" or other equally street-smart phrases that manage to incorporate both defensivness and threat. In any case, the implications are easily identifiable and the prmoise of quick retaliation looms in the foreground; rolling deep is a means of letting people know that you are not to be fucked with. The perils of being caught slippin' in this day and age are just too great. I know the value of rolling deep and have integrated it into my daily routine, rolling deep for such mundane tasks as getting a late- night snack from the fridge, buying a new sweater, or making a important phone call home. Hopefully some of the following tips, examples, and observations will acquaint you with the ways of rolling deep as fuck, 'cause it's too dangerous to be caught shallow.\r\n\r\nPut on the hardest clothes you can find (consult the latest number one video on Rap City) and practice scowling in the mirror for a few hours. The scowl is on the most integral aspects of rolling deep and must be perfected, although allowances can be made for the Flava-Flav type joker in every roup. Take a deep breath and tell yourself you are hard until you believe it. \r\nPretend you are in a rap video, running down the street in slow motion or backing up the MC. Visualize yourself as an actual member of a video posse. \r\nPractice the \"What the fuck?!\" arm gesture (both arms open, palms spread outward) until it becomes an automatic response to any question, especially if from a parent, cop, boss, or teacher. \r\nGrow some sort of \"hard\" facial hair. \r\nWear a very unhip pair of sunglasses--not bullshit Oakley or Arnet, but something like cop glasses or oversized mom-style glaasses. Basically anything you can snag out of a lost-and-found-bin will do. \r\nLook around a lot, like you expecting static from any direction. \r\nCultivate a fake limp or strut and walk extremely slowly. \r\nRefer to people only as \"bitches\" or \"fools.\" Learn to integrate the following words or phrases into your everyday speech, regardless of their meaning in your life: gat, nine, blast in the face, bitchslap, gangstalean, etc. \r\nYou are now ready to assemble the crew and synchronize the eight-step rolling deep program. Usually a larger group will signify a deeper roll, but this is not always the case. Certain people will never attain the ability to roll deep, no matter how much backup they have. Conversely, some motherfuckers roll deep when hanging out on solo tip. Some of the deepest rollers are the strong, silent types who can handles themselves in any situation. Consider the following list of some people who roll deep and some who don't quite make it.\r\n\r\nDeep As Fuck:\r\n\r\nWu-Tang, the Warriors (from that old '70s movie), this dude I once saw lounging in a designer sweatsuit and shades, Slayer.\r\n\r\nWading Pool:\r\n\r\nHammer, New Kids On The Block, Blackstreet, any fast food employee or manager, rock star snowboarders, bitch-ass rollerbladers.\r\n\r\nOf course those you new to the ways of rolling deep should never try to bust a flex on someone with experience. First things first, you should go in gradually, the way one would enter a pool of freezing water. You should initially roll deep only on inanimate objects such as street signs, a jammed or locked door, or a soda machine that shorted your coin. From that point you should work your way up to blind people or alley cats, but only when you feel comfortable. Progression will naturally lead you to flexin' on old ladies and infants.

It contained his most commercially famous songs, the infamous \"Closer\"  and \"Hurt\", which was later beautifully covered by Johnny Cash. \"The Downward Spiral\" was spun off with several remix EPs, including the extremely popular \"Further Down the Spiral\" and the dreaded by parents \"Closer to God\".\r\n\r\nTrent and [NIN] (Nine Inch Nails) spent a terribly long time touring \"The Downward Spiral\" and afterwards, Trent had no idea what to do.

Basically it is just a new gimic in order for Shire to be able to keep a steady cash flow when their patent on Adderall expires in 09.\r\n\r\nIt is an d-amphetamine or commonly known as dextroamphetamine except bonded with an additional protien, lysine, creating Lisdextroamphetamine Dimesylate which Shire then shortened and replaced the \"ph\" with an \"f\" resulting with lisdexamfetamine, because they believe it would help customers psychologically disassociate its relationship with the illegal drug amphetamine... nice\r\n\r\nalmost got me shire...\r\n\r\nOk, so brace yourselves.. this new protien not only greatly slows down the release of the dextro into your body, but it cannot be ingested anyway other than just poppin the pill... you can powder it up and drink it, but wont break the time release.  \r\n\r\nSo no snorting, or injecting... or any other dumb ideas you have.. The only way to truly break the time release is to manually hydrolize it, replacing your liver's job of removing the additional protien which isn't that hard to figure out you know your chemistry.\r\n\r\nBUT for the rest of you...\r\n\r\nits really not all that bad cuz now you don't have the opportunity to fuck up your nose lining, like i did. \r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nit actually gives you a really nice long lasting buzz/mood lift that is indistinguishable from adderall, but even cleaner if you are lookin for a good buzz all day. It doesnt make me really jittery like adderall does so I still have a hell of a lot of energy but a bit more relaxed.\r\n\r\nThese are the doses and exactly how much Adderall Extended Release they are equal to:\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 30 mg\u00e2\u0080\u0094white and orange capsule  10 = mg Adderall XR\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 50 mg\u00e2\u0080\u0094white and blue capsule    20 = mg Adderall XR\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 70 mg\u00e2\u0080\u0094blue and orange capsule   30 = mg Adderall XR\r\n\r\nSo you can do the math and see how much you would like.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT things to remember about this drug:\r\n\r\n   -It is watered down speed\r\n\r\n   -You can get addicted if you take large doses for days on end.. so dont.. withdrawls fuckin blow.\r\n\r\n   -The time release of dextro is VERY consistent for about 12-14 hours which increases with dose... so if you are going to use it as prescribed...

Bonus points if wizardesque clothing is worn!\r\n\r\nRules: At the beginning of the game, players decide on any special rules, including at which point a boss must be fought. Boss fighting will be discussed later but generally it happens every 3rd or 5th level. See the \"Special Rules\" section for further explanation. As well, if a prize is to be played for, it should be presented or decided on before play begins. After rules are decided and agreed upon (might be a good idea to write them down in case any late comers come in), all players open their first beverage. When a player has finished his or her first beverage they are now a \"Level 1 Wizard\". This is important since you can only call yourself a \"Level X Wizard\" when you have finished X number of beers. They must then \"Level Up\" by retrieving a full beverage, placing it on top of the now empty can, and securely taping the two together. FYI one or two good wraps of duct tape where the cans meet is usually sufficient, you don't want to over do it or you'll run out. Game play continues in this manner, leveling up after finishing each beverage until the pre-determined \"boss fighting\" level has been reached. \r\n\r\nBoss Fighting: This occurs once you are have finished your 5th beer, assuming you chose to fight a boss every 5th level (3rd beer for every 3rd, etc...). You cannot \"Level Up\" to a \"Level 5 Wizard\" (or whatever you chose) until you have fought a boss. This is done by choosing a hard liquor to take a shot of. Your choice is now called \"Boss 'name of liquor'\" i.e.: Jose Cuervo becomes either \"Boss Jose\" or \"Boss Cuervo\". Ideally, at least one other player will need to fight the boss with you, and it is considered acceptable to wait for them to finish a level to \"fight\" with you. As well, other players are encouraged to assist you in your \"battle\" with the boss, however doing so will not exempt them from fighting another boss when they reach the \"boss fighting level\". All players involved in the \"battle\" must pour a full shot of chosen liquor and then cheers and take it together. Once all shots are gone, the boss in considered defeated and all players needing to level up may now do so. Again, it's important to note that the boss comes at the end of the level; players \"Leveling up\" to Level 5 (or 3) will be getting their 6th (or 4th) beverage, and will retain \"Level 5 Wizard\" (or 3) status until they have finished it. No boss should be repeated until players have done battle with all available bosses.\r\n\r\nMini-Games: Players may choose to play other drinking games while playing Wisest Wizard. This is acceptable and encouraged! However, the rules as to how many levels can be obtained by winning a game should be decided on in advance to avoid confrontations later on. Our favorite is \"Wizard Chess\" better know to the layman as [Beirut] or [Beer Pong]. No changes to the game are made, however the winners of each game are awarded two levels (in the form of empty cans) each to add to their staffs. Losers get nothing as they lost the match. Any other game may be played as long as the levels to be awarded at the end are pre-determined. Simple games such as [Jacks and Fives] do not need any additional levels to be awarded as drinking will commence in a usual manner.\r\n\r\nSpecial Rules: As stated above, additional rules can be submitted at the beginning of the game to further enhance game play. All special rules and subsequent penalties for breaking the rule must be agreed upon by all players who are present at the beginning in order to be official. Any players arriving later in the game are automatically subjected to them. Examples of special rules are:\r\n - Appropriate Wizard Lingo must be used whenever possible:\r\n  - \"I'm feeling drunk\" = \"I'm feeling wise\"\r\n  - \"I need another beer\" = \"I need to Level Up\"\r\n  - \"Let's play Beirut\" = \"Let's play some Wizard Chess\"\r\nand so and so forth. \r\n - Current \"Wisest Wizard\" gets to create a rule upon \"Leveling up\". These rules are similar to rules from [King's Cup] and can either be permanent or last until he (or the new wisest wizard) levels up. Generally it's a good idea to set a starting point for this rule to come into effect, such as level 10 or 12, to avoid too many rules being created.\r\n\r\nWinning: In the end, everyone wins thanks to the copious amount of beverages that end up being consumed. However, the person who achieves the highest level is eligible to win a prize that was determined at the beginning of the game.
