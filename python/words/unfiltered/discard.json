Voice is produced when air is driven by the muscles of expiration from the lungs through the trachea and strikes against the two vocal cords (see cord), the vibrations of which produce sounds varying in different animals according to the structure of the organs and the power which the animal possesses over them. Voice can, therefore, be found only in animals in which this svstem of respiration is developed, and the lungs and larynx (or syrinx) actually exist. Fishes, having no lnngs, are dumb, as far as true vocal utterance is concerned, though various noises may issue from their throats (see croaker, grunt, and drum). In man the superior organization and mobility of the tongue and lips, as well as the perfection of the larynx, enable him to modify his vocal sounds to an almost infinite extent. In ordinary speaking the tones of the voice have nearly all the same pitch, and the variety of the sounds is due rather to the action of the mouth-organs than to definite movements of the glottis and vocal cords. In singing the successive sounds correspond more or less closely to the ideal tones of the musical scale. The male voice admits of division into tenor and bass, and the female into soprano and contralto. The lowest female tone is an octave or so higher than the lowest tone of the male voice; and the female's highest tone is about an octave above that of the male. The compass of both voices taken together is four octaves or more, the chief differences residing in the pitch and also in the timbre. In medicine, voice is the sound of utterance as transmitted through the lungs and chest-wall in auscultation. In zoology, voice is ordinarily restricted to respiratory sounds or vocal utterance, as above explained, and as distinguished from any mechanical noise, like stridulation, etc. The more usual word for the voice of any animal is cry; and the various cries, distinctive or characteristic of certain animals, take many distinctive terms, according to their vocal quality, as bark, bay, bellow, bleat, bray, cackle, call, caw, chatter, chirp, chirrup, cluck, coo, croak, crow, gabble, gobble, growl, grunt, hiss, honk, hoot, howl, low, mew, neigh, peep, pipe, purr, quack, roar, scream, screech, snarl, snort, song, squall, squawk, squeak, squeal, trumpet, twitter, warble, waul, whine, whinny, whistle, whoop, yawp, yell, yelp, and many others. The voices of some animals, as certain monkeys and large carnivores and ruminants, may be heard a mile; or more. The voice reaches its highest development, in animals other than human, in the distinctively musical class of birds, some of which, notably parrots and certain corvine and sturnoid birds, can be taught to talk intelligible speech.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "ergatogyne", "definition": "A female ant of worker-like aspect due to the absence of wings and wing-muscles; an ergatoid female.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "macrogyne", "definition": "A female, or queen, ant of conspicuously larger stature than the normal female form of the species.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "microgyne", "definition": "A female or queen ant of smaller stature than the typical female form of the species.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "htmlplease", "definition": "The sex chromosome associated with female characteristics in mammals, occurring paired in the female and single in the male.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "dug", "definition": "A teat, pap, or nipple; -- formerly that of a human mother, nowthat of a cow or other beast.With mother's dug between its lips.

Malignant tumors growby infiltration and destruction of the surrounding tissues, and are characterized by a tendency to recur after removal, by the property of spreading to other parts of the body by a process of dissemination known as metastasis, and by producing a general disturbance of health termed cachexia. From the standpoint, of the pathologist two chief groups of cancerous tumors are recognized: the carcinomata, or true cancers, and the sarcomata. The fundamental difference between these two is the fact that carcinoma originates in the epithelial tissues of the body, whereas sarcoma develops from the connective tissues. This difference in origin gives rise to certain structural characteristics which enable the microscopist readily to distinguish one type from the other. Carcinoma is rare before the age of thirty; it is somewhat commoner in women than in men; and it is most often seen in the uterus, skin, breast, and stomach. Sarcoma is a disease of early adult life, is more prone to attack men than women, and is commonly found in the subcutaneous tissue, bony structures, and lymph-nodes. Carcinoma is conveyed from one part of the body to another through the lymphatic vessels, sarcoma by way of the blood-stream. In spite of an enormous amount of research devoted to this subject, the exciting cause of cancer is still unknown. The influences of heredity, climate, food, race, social condition, and local injury have all been invoked as factors concerned, but without arriving at any degree of certainty. The theory referring the developmentof malignant tumors to the presence of minute animal or vegetable organisms has numerous adherents, but it has not been definitely established, and many prominent authorities consider that the explanation is to be sought for in a disturbance of some still undiscovered fundamental law governing the growth of cells. Although it appears that cancer is increasing somewhat in frequency, the percentage of cures is increasing much more rapidly, owing to the earlier diagnoses and more thorough operations which are now possible. Extirpation by the knife as promptly and as completely as possible, when the growth is accessible, is regarded as the method of treatment that offers the greatest hope of a cure; but the employment of the X-rays or other form of radioactivity has in a number of instances given excellent results.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "jippo", "definition": "A waistcoat or kind of stays for women.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["webster"]}, {"word": "fichu", "definition": "a lightweight triangular scarf worn by a woman", "gender": "female", "tags": ["datamuse"]}, {"word": "jabot", "definition": "a ruffle on the front of a woman's blouse or a man's shirt", "gender": "female", "tags": ["datamuse"]}, {"word": "jury of matrons", "definition": "a jury of experienced women called to determine the question of pregnancy when set up in bar of execution, and for other cognate purposes.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "machismo", "definition": "A strong or exaggerated sense of masculinity stressing attributes such as physical courage, virility, domination of women, and aggressiveness.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "evening bag", "definition": "a small dressy handbag, richly decorated, carried by women for formal occasions in the evening.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "lozenge", "definition": "A form of the escutcheon used by women instead of the shield which is used by men.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "luster", "definition": "A fabric of wool and cotton with a lustrous surface, -- used for women's dresses.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "loin", "definition": "The pubic area; the genitalia, especially in women.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "mantelet", "definition": "short cape worn by women", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "dangler", "definition": "One who dangles about or after others, especially after women;a trifler. \" Danglers at toilets.\" Burke.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["webster"]}, {"word": "delaine", "definition": "A kind of fabric for women's dresses.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["webster"]}, {"word": "dildo", "definition": "a device shaped like an erect penis, used by some women for sexual stimulation.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "dimity", "definition": "A cotton fabric employed for hangings and furniture coverings,and formerly used for women's under-garments.

Share is still more suggestive of the person connected with the matter: as. his share in the work; his portion of his father's estate was $100,000,and he insisted upon receiving his share at once. A division is one of two or more parts made by design, the parts still remaining connected: as, a division of an army or a fleet, of a subject, of a country.
