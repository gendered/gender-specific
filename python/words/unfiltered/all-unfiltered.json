Voice is produced when air is driven by the muscles of expiration from the lungs through the trachea and strikes against the two vocal cords (see cord), the vibrations of which produce sounds varying in different animals according to the structure of the organs and the power which the animal possesses over them. Voice can, therefore, be found only in animals in which this svstem of respiration is developed, and the lungs and larynx (or syrinx) actually exist. Fishes, having no lnngs, are dumb, as far as true vocal utterance is concerned, though various noises may issue from their throats (see croaker, grunt, and drum). In man the superior organization and mobility of the tongue and lips, as well as the perfection of the larynx, enable him to modify his vocal sounds to an almost infinite extent. In ordinary speaking the tones of the voice have nearly all the same pitch, and the variety of the sounds is due rather to the action of the mouth-organs than to definite movements of the glottis and vocal cords. In singing the successive sounds correspond more or less closely to the ideal tones of the musical scale. The male voice admits of division into tenor and bass, and the female into soprano and contralto. The lowest female tone is an octave or so higher than the lowest tone of the male voice; and the female's highest tone is about an octave above that of the male. The compass of both voices taken together is four octaves or more, the chief differences residing in the pitch and also in the timbre. In medicine, voice is the sound of utterance as transmitted through the lungs and chest-wall in auscultation. In zoology, voice is ordinarily restricted to respiratory sounds or vocal utterance, as above explained, and as distinguished from any mechanical noise, like stridulation, etc. The more usual word for the voice of any animal is cry; and the various cries, distinctive or characteristic of certain animals, take many distinctive terms, according to their vocal quality, as bark, bay, bellow, bleat, bray, cackle, call, caw, chatter, chirp, chirrup, cluck, coo, croak, crow, gabble, gobble, growl, grunt, hiss, honk, hoot, howl, low, mew, neigh, peep, pipe, purr, quack, roar, scream, screech, snarl, snort, song, squall, squawk, squeak, squeal, trumpet, twitter, warble, waul, whine, whinny, whistle, whoop, yawp, yell, yelp, and many others. The voices of some animals, as certain monkeys and large carnivores and ruminants, may be heard a mile; or more. The voice reaches its highest development, in animals other than human, in the distinctively musical class of birds, some of which, notably parrots and certain corvine and sturnoid birds, can be taught to talk intelligible speech.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "jenny ass", "definition": "a female ass; also, a female of certain other animals.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "chairwoman", "definition": "a female officer who presides at the meetings of a committee, meeting, or organization; a female chairperson.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "ergatogyne", "definition": "A female ant of worker-like aspect due to the absence of wings and wing-muscles; an ergatoid female.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "macrogyne", "definition": "A female, or queen, ant of conspicuously larger stature than the normal female form of the species.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "microgyne", "definition": "A female or queen ant of smaller stature than the typical female form of the species.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "mixogamy", "definition": "In ichthyology, congregation in unequal numbers of male and female fishes in spawning-time, the males being in excess and several males attending one female for a time and then changing for another.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "oratrix", "definition": "In law, a female petitioner or female plaintiff in a bill in chancery.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "htmlplease", "definition": "The sex chromosome associated with female characteristics in mammals, occurring paired in the female and single in the male.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "gallantry", "definition": "Civility or polite attention to ladies; in a bad sense, attention or courtesy designed to win criminal favors from a female; freedom of principle or practice with respect to female virtue; intrigue.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "dey", "definition": "A female (sometimes a male) servant who had charge of a dairy and all things pertaining to it; a female servant in general.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "dug", "definition": "The pap or nipple of a woman or a female animal; the breast, with reference to suckling.

Malignant tumors growby infiltration and destruction of the surrounding tissues, and are characterized by a tendency to recur after removal, by the property of spreading to other parts of the body by a process of dissemination known as metastasis, and by producing a general disturbance of health termed cachexia. From the standpoint, of the pathologist two chief groups of cancerous tumors are recognized: the carcinomata, or true cancers, and the sarcomata. The fundamental difference between these two is the fact that carcinoma originates in the epithelial tissues of the body, whereas sarcoma develops from the connective tissues. This difference in origin gives rise to certain structural characteristics which enable the microscopist readily to distinguish one type from the other. Carcinoma is rare before the age of thirty; it is somewhat commoner in women than in men; and it is most often seen in the uterus, skin, breast, and stomach. Sarcoma is a disease of early adult life, is more prone to attack men than women, and is commonly found in the subcutaneous tissue, bony structures, and lymph-nodes. Carcinoma is conveyed from one part of the body to another through the lymphatic vessels, sarcoma by way of the blood-stream. In spite of an enormous amount of research devoted to this subject, the exciting cause of cancer is still unknown. The influences of heredity, climate, food, race, social condition, and local injury have all been invoked as factors concerned, but without arriving at any degree of certainty. The theory referring the developmentof malignant tumors to the presence of minute animal or vegetable organisms has numerous adherents, but it has not been definitely established, and many prominent authorities consider that the explanation is to be sought for in a disturbance of some still undiscovered fundamental law governing the growth of cells. Although it appears that cancer is increasing somewhat in frequency, the percentage of cures is increasing much more rapidly, owing to the earlier diagnoses and more thorough operations which are now possible. Extirpation by the knife as promptly and as completely as possible, when the growth is accessible, is regarded as the method of treatment that offers the greatest hope of a cure; but the employment of the X-rays or other form of radioactivity has in a number of instances given excellent results.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "jippo", "definition": "A waistcoat or kind of stays for women.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "male chauvinist", "definition": "A man with a belief in the inferiority of women; one who believes in or practises male chavinism.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "jabot", "definition": "An arrangement of lace or tulle, looped ornamentally, and worn by women on the front of the dress.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "maharmah", "definition": "A muslin wrapper for the head and the lower part of the face, worn by Turkish and Armenian women when they go abroad.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "maternity ward", "definition": "The section of a hospital devoted to assisting women during childbirth and caring for them and their newborn infants until they are released to go home.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "jury of matrons", "definition": "a jury of experienced women called to determine the question of pregnancy when set up in bar of execution, and for other cognate purposes.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "machismo", "definition": "A strong, and by some considered exaggerated, sense of manly pride, associated with an attitude that the proper expression of masculinity includes virility, courage, and an entitlement to dominate, especially over women.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "evening bag", "definition": "a small dressy handbag, richly decorated, carried by women for formal occasions in the evening.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "lozenge", "definition": "A form of the escutcheon used by women instead of the shield which is used by men.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "luster", "definition": "A fabric of wool and cotton with a lustrous surface, -- used for women's dresses.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "masher", "definition": "A charmer of women.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "loin", "definition": "The pubic area; the genitalia, especially in women.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "mantelet", "definition": "A short cloak or mantle worn by women.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "mantuamaker", "definition": "One who makes dresses, cloaks, etc., for women; a dressmaker.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "dongola race", "definition": "a boat race in which the crews are composed of a number of pairs, usually of men and women.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "double standard", "definition": "a standard or set of principles governing conduct, which is applied more stringently or differently to one group of people than to another; -- used especially of standards of sexual behavior that condemn behavior on the part of women that is condoned or not condemned when exhibited by men.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "incubus", "definition": "A demon; a fiend; a lascivious spirit, supposed to have sexual intercourse with women by night.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "libertine", "definition": "One of a sect of Anabaptists, in the fifteenth and early part of the sixteenth century, who rejected many of the customs and decencies of life, and advocated a community of goods and of women.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "dangler", "definition": "One who dangles about or after others, especially after women; a trifler.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "delaine", "definition": "A kind of fabric for women's dresses.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "dildo", "definition": "a device shaped like an erect penis, used by some women for sexual stimulation.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "com\u00e9dienne", "definition": "A women who plays in comedy.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "corroboree", "definition": "A nocturnal festivity with which the Australian aborigines celebrate tribal events of importance.

When the horoscope of birth was not known, astrologers were accustomed to determine elections chiefly by the place and phase of the moon, whose influence was, however, considered debile. It appears that in the case of the lady of the story, the moon was impedited in the root of nativity (see Almansor, Prop. 35: \u201cCum in radice nativitatis impedietur luna,\u201d etc.), and Mars, a planet most unfavorable to journeys, was at azir, or lord of the ascendant, at her birth, and was in the fourth, or darkest, house; so that the omens of the journey were as gloomy as they well could be.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "serenade", "definition": "In music, an evening song; especially, such a song sung by a lover at the window of his lady.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "smell-smock", "definition": "The lady's-smock, Cardamine pratensis; rarely, the wind-flower, Anemone nemorosa, Britten and Holland, Eng.

The cow-pea is an annual, its numerous varieties passing through all grades of bush, trailing, and running habit, the less rampant being better adapted to short seasons. It requires much heat and will bear no frost; hence it is most at home in the South, but varieties have been secured which will mature in 60 days, and its culture is extending northward. In the southern United States it has long been of great value, and with the introduction of mixed farming is increasingly appreciated. It is available for forage and soiling and for hay, in the latter use, when well cured, ranking with red clover; and it is one of the foremost nitrogen-gatherers.

By derivation and by Biblical usage atonement and reconciliation are essentially the same: two that were alienated are made at one, or put back into friendship.

As applied to the relations of God and man, atonement has been lifted into much greater dignity than any other word in the list; it is now the august, chosen, and only endeared word for the effect of the life and especially of the death of Christ in establishing right relations between God and man; reconcile and reconciliation are the principal words for this in the New Testament, atonement being used only once, and atone not at all. Propitiation is the only one of these words having exclusive reference to the feelings or purposes of the person or being offended; it is a severe word, implying slowness to relent, and is, in regard to the attitude of God toward man, chiefly a theological term. Expiation regards the guilt of the offense; it is the suffering of the penalty proper for an act (as, to make expiation for one's crime upon the scaffold), or of an adequate substituted pain. The word is general, and only barely Biblical (Num. xxxv. 33, margin, and revised version), although the fact is by the mass of Christians believed to lie in some form in the sufferings of Christ.

Discipline is essentially the same as training, but more severe. Nurture, by its derivation, expresses a tender, continuous, and protracted training, beginning at an early age. Cultivation, in the active sense, is often used of the training, discipline, or development of some single department of the nature: as, the cultivation of the understanding, the taste, the conscience.

Instruction has the imparting of knowledge for its object, but emphasizes, more than teaching, the employment of orderly arrangement in the things taught.

See Pithecanthropus, 1.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "urine", "definition": "The daily elimination of solids in the urine normally varies between 40 and 60 grams, of which almost 40 per cent. consists of mineral salts, the remainder of organic bodies. Of the mineral salts chlorids predominate, the amount, varying between 10 and 15 grams, being largely dependent upon the quantity ingested. As this in turn is greatly influenced by the appetite, the elimination of chlorids is, generally speaking, a fair index of the latter. Of other mineral salts sulphates and phosphates of the alkalis and the alkaline earths predominate; in addition there are traces of fluorides and nitrates. Among the organic waste products which appear in the urine of man urea is the most important. Fully 85 per cent. of the nitrogenous tissue-waste appears in this form. The daily amount varies to a great extent with the appetite and accordingly with the quantity of nitrogenous food consumed, but is on the whole fairly constant for one and the same individual: 20\u201330 grams per day may be regarded as a fair average, but, as overeating is on the whole very common, an elimination of 40\u201350 grams is not infrequently noted. In some of the lower animals, notably in birds and reptiles, uric acid is the principal nitrogenous component of the urine, while urea is found only in small amounts. In man it is unusual to meet with larger quantities than 0.6\u20131.0 gram in the twenty-four hours. In birds and reptiles it is formed synthetically in a manner quite analogous to the production of urea, but in man this mode of formation has not been satisfactorily demonstrated. Its origin here is to be sought in the destruction of nucleins, the resultant xanthin bases giving rise to uric acid on oxidation. Xanthin bases, comprising xanthin, hypoxanthin, guanine, carnin, paraxanthin, heteroxanthin, and episarcine, are found normally only in very small quantity; generally speaking, this represents about 10 per cent. of the amount of uric acid. Theobromine and caffein (derived from cocoa and coffee and tea, respectively) are partly eliminated in the urine as such, while in part they appear as methyl-xanthin (heteroxanthin). Among other organic components which are normally found in the urine are oxalic and oxaluric acid, creatinine, allantoin, hippuric acid, phenol, cresol, pyrocatechin, hydroquinone, indican, scatoxyl sulphate, glycuronic acid, various fatty acids, certain neutral sulphur bodies, such as sulphocyanides, oxy- and alloxy-proteinic acid, various pigments, ferments, etc. Collectively, these bodies are only present in very small amounts: they are in part of tissue origin, that is, metabolic waste products, and in part products of albuminous putrefaction, formed in the intestinal canal. Among the latter indican and scatoxyl sulphate merit especial attention. The mother-substances of the two are indol and skatol, respectively, which, after oxidation to indoxyl and scatoxyl, unite with sulphuric acid, and are then eliminated as the corresponding sodium and potassium salts. Both indoxyl and scatoxyl are chromogens and on oxidation give rise to various pigments, of which the indigo blue derived from indican is the most abundant. The amount of the latter is, roughly speaking, an index of the degree of intestinal putrefaction. Under certain conditions, which are as yet but little understood but which can scarcely be classified as pathological, still other substances appear in the urine, among which cystin and alkapton (homogentisinic acid) are the most noteworthy. Both cystinuria and alkaptonuria are the expression of curious metabolic anomalies. Both may occur in families, and commonly appear early in life and persist throughout. In the case of alkaptonuria it has been shown that consanguinity of the parents may be an etiological factor, but in cystinuria this is not the case. Neither condition per se is pathological, but, owing to the readiness with which cystin separates from the urine in solid form, and the resultant disturbances in the course of the urinary tract, cystinuria in a general way tends to shorten life. Associated with cystinuria there is at times diaminuria (appearance of putrescin and cadaverin). Under pathological conditions marked quantitative variations occur both in the amount of urine per se,, as also in its various normal components, depending to a great-extent upon diminished ingestion of food and increased tissue-waste. Of abnormal constituents which may be met with in disease, the most notable are the serum albumin and serum globulin of the blood, blood as such, albumoses, sugar (dextrose), diacetic acid, beta-oxybutyric acid, lactic acid, biliary constituents, chyle, certain abnormal chromogens, pigments, etc. Traces of albumin may be met with in some individuals who are apparently in perfect health (physiological albuminuria), but, generally speaking, albuminuria is a pathological phenomenon, though not necessarily the indication of a nephritis. The renal epithelium responds to any abnormal stimulus with albuminuria, and it is thus readily understood that the condition may be merely temporary and of comparatively little significance. Long-continued albuminuria, however, especially when occurring in individuals who have reached maturity, and in whom a direct cause of the anomaly is not at once apparent, should always be viewed with anxiety. The amount of albumin which may appear in the urine varies from just discernible traces to 1.5\u20133 per cent. The largest amounts of albumin are met with in a comparatively rare disease, multiple myelomatosis, in which a peculiar albuminous substance, differing from the common albumins of the blood, is met with, the so-called albumin of Bence Jones. The daily elimination may here equal the entire amount of the blood albumins. The elimination of glucose (glucosuria), like that of albumin, is essentially an abnormal phenomenon, and is observed in a large number of pathological conditions, but may also follow the ingestion of excessive amounts of sugar in normal individuals. In disease it may be either temporary or permanent. The latter occurs in diabetes mellitus. In such cases, particularly when advanced, acetone, diacetic, and betaoxybutyric acid are also present, but may likewise occur in other conditions. The ensemble, however, is especially characteristic of the disease in question. Biliary constituents are met with whenever the outflow of bile through the natural channels is impeded. Of the pathological chromogens, finally, one merits especial consideration. It is met with notably in typhoid fever, and on treatment with diazobenzone sulphonic acid, in the presence of ammonia, such urine gives rise to a garnet-red color. Its presence, though observed in other pathological conditions also, is especially constant in typhoid fever and of distinct diagnostic importance. In cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, where the reaction is also encountered, its occurrence is generally viewed as a symptom of grave prognostic import.

Knowledge has several steps, as the perception of facts, the accumulation of facts, and familiarity by experience, but it does not include action, nor the power of judging what is best in ends to be pursued or in means for attaining those ends. Prudence is sometimes the power of judging what are the best means for attaining desired ends; it may be a word or action, or it may be simply the power to avoid danger. It implies deliberation and care, whether in acting or refraining from action. Wisdom chooses not only the best means but also the best ends; it is thus far higher than prudence, which may by choosing wrong ends go altogether astray; hence also it is often used in the Bible for piety. As compared with knowledge, it sees more deeply into the heart of things and more broadly and comprehensively sums up relations, draws conclusions, and acts upon them; hence a man may abound in knowledge and be very deficient in wisdom, or he may have a practical wisdom with a comparatively small stock of knowledge. Discretion is the power to judge critically what is correct and proper, sometimes without suggesting action, but more often in view of action proposed or possible. Like prudence the word implies great caution, and takes for granted that a man will not act contrary to what he knows. Providence looks much further ahead than prudence or discretion, and plans and acts according to what it sees. It may be remarked that provision, which is from the same root as providence and prudence, is primarily a word of action, while they are only secondarily so. Forecast is a grave word for looking carefully forward to the consequences of present situations and decisions; it implies, like all these words except knowledge, that one will act according to what he can make out of the future.

At an early date it was not unusual to admit young boys, even of five or six, to the office of reader, but by the sixth century the age of eighteen was required by law. In the Roman Catholic Church this order is little more than one of the steps to the priesthood. The reader (lector) ranks above a doorkeeper and below an exorcist, and the form of ordination is the delivery to him of the book from which he is to read. In the Greek church the reader (anagnost) ranks below a subdeacon, and it is his office, as it was in the early church, to read the Epistle, the deacon reading the Gospel. In the Church of England the order fell into abeyance after the Reformation, but lay readers were frequently licensed, especially in churches or chapels without a clergyman. They could not minister the sacraments and other rites of the church, except the burial of the dead and the churching of women, nor pronounce the absolution and benediction. Of late years, however, bishops have regularly admitted candidates to the office of reader by delivery of a copy of the New Testament. In the American Episcopal Church lay readers conduct services in vaeant churches or under a rector by his request with license from the bishop for a definite period (a year or less). They cannot give absolution or benediction, administer sacraments, nor use the occasional offices of the church except those for the burial of the dead and visitation of the sick and prisoners, nor deliver sermons of their own composition.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "scent", "definition": "Scraps of paper strewed on the ground by the pursued in the boys' game of hare and hounds, or by the \u201cfox\u201d in a paper-hunt, to enable the pursuers to track them or him.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "ben", "definition": "In mining: The right to enter the mine and work.
