Voice is produced when air is driven by the muscles of expiration from the lungs through the trachea and strikes against the two vocal cords (see cord), the vibrations of which produce sounds varying in different animals according to the structure of the organs and the power which the animal possesses over them. Voice can, therefore, be found only in animals in which this svstem of respiration is developed, and the lungs and larynx (or syrinx) actually exist. Fishes, having no lnngs, are dumb, as far as true vocal utterance is concerned, though various noises may issue from their throats (see croaker, grunt, and drum). In man the superior organization and mobility of the tongue and lips, as well as the perfection of the larynx, enable him to modify his vocal sounds to an almost infinite extent. In ordinary speaking the tones of the voice have nearly all the same pitch, and the variety of the sounds is due rather to the action of the mouth-organs than to definite movements of the glottis and vocal cords. In singing the successive sounds correspond more or less closely to the ideal tones of the musical scale. The male voice admits of division into tenor and bass, and the female into soprano and contralto. The lowest female tone is an octave or so higher than the lowest tone of the male voice; and the female's highest tone is about an octave above that of the male. The compass of both voices taken together is four octaves or more, the chief differences residing in the pitch and also in the timbre. In medicine, voice is the sound of utterance as transmitted through the lungs and chest-wall in auscultation. In zoology, voice is ordinarily restricted to respiratory sounds or vocal utterance, as above explained, and as distinguished from any mechanical noise, like stridulation, etc. The more usual word for the voice of any animal is cry; and the various cries, distinctive or characteristic of certain animals, take many distinctive terms, according to their vocal quality, as bark, bay, bellow, bleat, bray, cackle, call, caw, chatter, chirp, chirrup, cluck, coo, croak, crow, gabble, gobble, growl, grunt, hiss, honk, hoot, howl, low, mew, neigh, peep, pipe, purr, quack, roar, scream, screech, snarl, snort, song, squall, squawk, squeak, squeal, trumpet, twitter, warble, waul, whine, whinny, whistle, whoop, yawp, yell, yelp, and many others. The voices of some animals, as certain monkeys and large carnivores and ruminants, may be heard a mile; or more. The voice reaches its highest development, in animals other than human, in the distinctively musical class of birds, some of which, notably parrots and certain corvine and sturnoid birds, can be taught to talk intelligible speech.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "jenny ass", "definition": "a female ass; also, a female of certain other animals.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "jewess", "definition": "A female Jew; a Hebrew woman; a female adherent of Judaism.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "lady fern", "definition": "See Female fern, under Female, and Illust. of Fern.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "chairwoman", "definition": "a female officer who presides at the meetings of a committee, meeting, or organization; a female chairperson.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "ergatogyne", "definition": "A female ant of worker-like aspect due to the absence of wings and wing-muscles; an ergatoid female.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "macrogyne", "definition": "A female, or queen, ant of conspicuously larger stature than the normal female form of the species.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "microgyne", "definition": "A female or queen ant of smaller stature than the typical female form of the species.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "mixogamy", "definition": "In ichthyology, congregation in unequal numbers of male and female fishes in spawning-time, the males being in excess and several males attending one female for a time and then changing for another.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "negress", "definition": "A female negro; a female of one of the black races of Africa.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "oratrix", "definition": "In law, a female petitioner or female plaintiff in a bill in chancery.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "htmlplease", "definition": "The sex chromosome associated with female characteristics in mammals, occurring paired in the female and single in the male.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "gallantry", "definition": "Civility or polite attention to ladies; in a bad sense, attention or courtesy designed to win criminal favors from a female; freedom of principle or practice with respect to female virtue; intrigue.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "bondmaid", "definition": "A female slave, or a female bound to service without wages.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "conqueress", "definition": "A female who conquers; a victorious female.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "dey", "definition": "A female (sometimes a male) servant who had charge of a dairy and all things pertaining to it; a female servant in general.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "dug", "definition": "The pap or nipple of a woman or a female animal; the breast, with reference to suckling.

Malignant tumors growby infiltration and destruction of the surrounding tissues, and are characterized by a tendency to recur after removal, by the property of spreading to other parts of the body by a process of dissemination known as metastasis, and by producing a general disturbance of health termed cachexia. From the standpoint, of the pathologist two chief groups of cancerous tumors are recognized: the carcinomata, or true cancers, and the sarcomata. The fundamental difference between these two is the fact that carcinoma originates in the epithelial tissues of the body, whereas sarcoma develops from the connective tissues. This difference in origin gives rise to certain structural characteristics which enable the microscopist readily to distinguish one type from the other. Carcinoma is rare before the age of thirty; it is somewhat commoner in women than in men; and it is most often seen in the uterus, skin, breast, and stomach. Sarcoma is a disease of early adult life, is more prone to attack men than women, and is commonly found in the subcutaneous tissue, bony structures, and lymph-nodes. Carcinoma is conveyed from one part of the body to another through the lymphatic vessels, sarcoma by way of the blood-stream. In spite of an enormous amount of research devoted to this subject, the exciting cause of cancer is still unknown. The influences of heredity, climate, food, race, social condition, and local injury have all been invoked as factors concerned, but without arriving at any degree of certainty. The theory referring the developmentof malignant tumors to the presence of minute animal or vegetable organisms has numerous adherents, but it has not been definitely established, and many prominent authorities consider that the explanation is to be sought for in a disturbance of some still undiscovered fundamental law governing the growth of cells.

When the horoscope of birth was not known, astrologers were accustomed to determine elections chiefly by the place and phase of the moon, whose influence was, however, considered debile. It appears that in the case of the lady of the story, the moon was impedited in the root of nativity (see Almansor, Prop. 35: \u201cCum in radice nativitatis impedietur luna,\u201d etc.), and Mars, a planet most unfavorable to journeys, was at azir, or lord of the ascendant, at her birth, and was in the fourth, or darkest, house; so that the omens of the journey were as gloomy as they well could be.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "se\u00f1orita", "definition": "A young lady; in address, miss; as a title, Miss: in Spanish use.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "serenade", "definition": "In music, an evening song; especially, such a song sung by a lover at the window of his lady.", "gender": "female", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "smell-smock", "definition": "The lady's-smock, Cardamine pratensis; rarely, the wind-flower, Anemone nemorosa, Britten and Holland, Eng.

The cow-pea is an annual, its numerous varieties passing through all grades of bush, trailing, and running habit, the less rampant being better adapted to short seasons. It requires much heat and will bear no frost; hence it is most at home in the South, but varieties have been secured which will mature in 60 days, and its culture is extending northward.

As applied to the relations of God and man, atonement has been lifted into much greater dignity than any other word in the list; it is now the august, chosen, and only endeared word for the effect of the life and especially of the death of Christ in establishing right relations between God and man; reconcile and reconciliation are the principal words for this in the New Testament, atonement being used only once, and atone not at all. Propitiation is the only one of these words having exclusive reference to the feelings or purposes of the person or being offended; it is a severe word, implying slowness to relent, and is, in regard to the attitude of God toward man, chiefly a theological term. Expiation regards the guilt of the offense; it is the suffering of the penalty proper for an act (as, to make expiation for one's crime upon the scaffold), or of an adequate substituted pain. The word is general, and only barely Biblical (Num. xxxv. 33, margin, and revised version), although the fact is by the mass of Christians believed to lie in some form in the sufferings of Christ.

Instruction has the imparting of knowledge for its object, but emphasizes, more than teaching, the employment of orderly arrangement in the things taught.

Of the mineral salts chlorids predominate, the amount, varying between 10 and 15 grams, being largely dependent upon the quantity ingested. As this in turn is greatly influenced by the appetite, the elimination of chlorids is, generally speaking, a fair index of the latter. Of other mineral salts sulphates and phosphates of the alkalis and the alkaline earths predominate; in addition there are traces of fluorides and nitrates. Among the organic waste products which appear in the urine of man urea is the most important. Fully 85 per cent. of the nitrogenous tissue-waste appears in this form. The daily amount varies to a great extent with the appetite and accordingly with the quantity of nitrogenous food consumed, but is on the whole fairly constant for one and the same individual: 20\u201330 grams per day may be regarded as a fair average, but, as overeating is on the whole very common, an elimination of 40\u201350 grams is not infrequently noted. In some of the lower animals, notably in birds and reptiles, uric acid is the principal nitrogenous component of the urine, while urea is found only in small amounts. In man it is unusual to meet with larger quantities than 0.6\u20131.0 gram in the twenty-four hours. In birds and reptiles it is formed synthetically in a manner quite analogous to the production of urea, but in man this mode of formation has not been satisfactorily demonstrated. Its origin here is to be sought in the destruction of nucleins, the resultant xanthin bases giving rise to uric acid on oxidation. Xanthin bases, comprising xanthin, hypoxanthin, guanine, carnin, paraxanthin, heteroxanthin, and episarcine, are found normally only in very small quantity; generally speaking, this represents about 10 per cent. of the amount of uric acid. Theobromine and caffein (derived from cocoa and coffee and tea, respectively) are partly eliminated in the urine as such, while in part they appear as methyl-xanthin (heteroxanthin). Among other organic components which are normally found in the urine are oxalic and oxaluric acid, creatinine, allantoin, hippuric acid, phenol, cresol, pyrocatechin, hydroquinone, indican, scatoxyl sulphate, glycuronic acid, various fatty acids, certain neutral sulphur bodies, such as sulphocyanides, oxy- and alloxy-proteinic acid, various pigments, ferments, etc. Collectively, these bodies are only present in very small amounts: they are in part of tissue origin, that is, metabolic waste products, and in part products of albuminous putrefaction, formed in the intestinal canal. Among the latter indican and scatoxyl sulphate merit especial attention. The mother-substances of the two are indol and skatol, respectively, which, after oxidation to indoxyl and scatoxyl, unite with sulphuric acid, and are then eliminated as the corresponding sodium and potassium salts. Both indoxyl and scatoxyl are chromogens and on oxidation give rise to various pigments, of which the indigo blue derived from indican is the most abundant. The amount of the latter is, roughly speaking, an index of the degree of intestinal putrefaction. Under certain conditions, which are as yet but little understood but which can scarcely be classified as pathological, still other substances appear in the urine, among which cystin and alkapton (homogentisinic acid) are the most noteworthy. Both cystinuria and alkaptonuria are the expression of curious metabolic anomalies. Both may occur in families, and commonly appear early in life and persist throughout. In the case of alkaptonuria it has been shown that consanguinity of the parents may be an etiological factor, but in cystinuria this is not the case. Neither condition per se is pathological, but, owing to the readiness with which cystin separates from the urine in solid form, and the resultant disturbances in the course of the urinary tract, cystinuria in a general way tends to shorten life. Associated with cystinuria there is at times diaminuria (appearance of putrescin and cadaverin). Under pathological conditions marked quantitative variations occur both in the amount of urine per se,, as also in its various normal components, depending to a great-extent upon diminished ingestion of food and increased tissue-waste. Of abnormal constituents which may be met with in disease, the most notable are the serum albumin and serum globulin of the blood, blood as such, albumoses, sugar (dextrose), diacetic acid, beta-oxybutyric acid, lactic acid, biliary constituents, chyle, certain abnormal chromogens, pigments, etc. Traces of albumin may be met with in some individuals who are apparently in perfect health (physiological albuminuria), but, generally speaking, albuminuria is a pathological phenomenon, though not necessarily the indication of a nephritis. The renal epithelium responds to any abnormal stimulus with albuminuria, and it is thus readily understood that the condition may be merely temporary and of comparatively little significance. Long-continued albuminuria, however, especially when occurring in individuals who have reached maturity, and in whom a direct cause of the anomaly is not at once apparent, should always be viewed with anxiety. The amount of albumin which may appear in the urine varies from just discernible traces to 1.5\u20133 per cent. The largest amounts of albumin are met with in a comparatively rare disease, multiple myelomatosis, in which a peculiar albuminous substance, differing from the common albumins of the blood, is met with, the so-called albumin of Bence Jones. The daily elimination may here equal the entire amount of the blood albumins. The elimination of glucose (glucosuria), like that of albumin, is essentially an abnormal phenomenon, and is observed in a large number of pathological conditions, but may also follow the ingestion of excessive amounts of sugar in normal individuals. In disease it may be either temporary or permanent. The latter occurs in diabetes mellitus. In such cases, particularly when advanced, acetone, diacetic, and betaoxybutyric acid are also present, but may likewise occur in other conditions. The ensemble, however, is especially characteristic of the disease in question. Biliary constituents are met with whenever the outflow of bile through the natural channels is impeded. Of the pathological chromogens, finally, one merits especial consideration. It is met with notably in typhoid fever, and on treatment with diazobenzone sulphonic acid, in the presence of ammonia, such urine gives rise to a garnet-red color. Its presence, though observed in other pathological conditions also, is especially constant in typhoid fever and of distinct diagnostic importance. In cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, where the reaction is also encountered, its occurrence is generally viewed as a symptom of grave prognostic import.

Voice is produced when air is driven by the muscles of expiration from the lungs through the trachea and strikes against the two vocal cords (see cord), the vibrations of which produce sounds varying in different animals according to the structure of the organs and the power which the animal possesses over them. Voice can, therefore, be found only in animals in which this svstem of respiration is developed, and the lungs and larynx (or syrinx) actually exist. Fishes, having no lnngs, are dumb, as far as true vocal utterance is concerned, though various noises may issue from their throats (see croaker, grunt, and drum). In man the superior organization and mobility of the tongue and lips, as well as the perfection of the larynx, enable him to modify his vocal sounds to an almost infinite extent. In ordinary speaking the tones of the voice have nearly all the same pitch, and the variety of the sounds is due rather to the action of the mouth-organs than to definite movements of the glottis and vocal cords. In singing the successive sounds correspond more or less closely to the ideal tones of the musical scale. The male voice admits of division into tenor and bass, and the female into soprano and contralto. The lowest female tone is an octave or so higher than the lowest tone of the male voice; and the female's highest tone is about an octave above that of the male. The compass of both voices taken together is four octaves or more, the chief differences residing in the pitch and also in the timbre. In medicine, voice is the sound of utterance as transmitted through the lungs and chest-wall in auscultation. In zoology, voice is ordinarily restricted to respiratory sounds or vocal utterance, as above explained, and as distinguished from any mechanical noise, like stridulation, etc. The more usual word for the voice of any animal is cry; and the various cries, distinctive or characteristic of certain animals, take many distinctive terms, according to their vocal quality, as bark, bay, bellow, bleat, bray, cackle, call, caw, chatter, chirp, chirrup, cluck, coo, croak, crow, gabble, gobble, growl, grunt, hiss, honk, hoot, howl, low, mew, neigh, peep, pipe, purr, quack, roar, scream, screech, snarl, snort, song, squall, squawk, squeak, squeal, trumpet, twitter, warble, waul, whine, whinny, whistle, whoop, yawp, yell, yelp, and many others. The voices of some animals, as certain monkeys and large carnivores and ruminants, may be heard a mile; or more.

Knowledge has several steps, as the perception of facts, the accumulation of facts, and familiarity by experience, but it does not include action, nor the power of judging what is best in ends to be pursued or in means for attaining those ends. Prudence is sometimes the power of judging what are the best means for attaining desired ends; it may be a word or action, or it may be simply the power to avoid danger. It implies deliberation and care, whether in acting or refraining from action. Wisdom chooses not only the best means but also the best ends; it is thus far higher than prudence, which may by choosing wrong ends go altogether astray; hence also it is often used in the Bible for piety. As compared with knowledge, it sees more deeply into the heart of things and more broadly and comprehensively sums up relations, draws conclusions, and acts upon them; hence a man may abound in knowledge and be very deficient in wisdom, or he may have a practical wisdom with a comparatively small stock of knowledge. Discretion is the power to judge critically what is correct and proper, sometimes without suggesting action, but more often in view of action proposed or possible. Like prudence the word implies great caution, and takes for granted that a man will not act contrary to what he knows. Providence looks much further ahead than prudence or discretion, and plans and acts according to what it sees. It may be remarked that provision, which is from the same root as providence and prudence, is primarily a word of action, while they are only secondarily so. Forecast is a grave word for looking carefully forward to the consequences of present situations and decisions; it implies, like all these words except knowledge, that one will act according to what he can make out of the future.

Each successive generation consists of dominants and recessives in the ratio, for each 100, of 25 dominants of pure blood, 25 recessives of pure blood, and 50 dominants which produce descendants in the ratio of three dominants to one recessive. This result is expressed by Mendel in the formula, for each successive generation. 25 DD; 50 DR; 25 R; but it may also be expressed as x + 2xy + y and the result of cross-breeding with any number of characters conforms closely to the algebraical binomial theorem, or the expansion of (a + b + c + \u2026. x). More recent study tends to show that Mendel's results hold good pretty generally, but by no means universally, in similar cases. Experiments and observations for the purpose of discovering the structural equivalent for the numerical law tend to support Mendel's opinion that there are, for two characters, four sorts of germ-cells in the reproductive organs of the cross-bred individuals\u2014dominant ova, recessive ova, dominant male cells, and recessive male cells\u2014and that, these are, on the average, equal in number, so that one quarter of the descendants are born from dominant ova fertilized by dominant male cells and are pure dominants; one quarter are born from recessive ova fertilized by recessive male cells, and are pure recessives; and one half are born from the union of an ovum of one sort with a male cell of the other sort, and are able to produce pure dominants, pure recessives, and cross-bred descendants in the original ratio.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "horse", "definition": "The male of the genus Equus, in distinction from the female or male; usually, a castrated male.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "sperm", "definition": "The male seed of any kind, as the semen or seminal fluid of the higher vertebrates, the male spawn or milt of the lower vertebrates, or the seminal elements of any animal, containing the male germs, or spermatozoa.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "sex", "definition": "The distinguishing peculiarity of male or female in both animals and plants; the physical difference between male and female; the assemblage of properties or qualities by which male is distinguished from female.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "agnation", "definition": "Relation by the father's side only; descent from a common male ancestor and in the male line: distinct from cognation, which includes descent in both the male and the female lines.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "tom", "definition": "Used, like jack, attributively or in composition with the name of an animal, a male: as, a tom-cat; hence, as a noun, a male; specifically, a male cat.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "voice", "definition": "Voice as a scientific term may mean either the faculty of nttering audible sounds, or the body of audible sounds produced by the organs of respiration, especially the larynx of man and other animals: contradistinguished from speech or articulate language. Voice is produced when air is driven by the muscles of expiration from the lungs through the trachea and strikes against the two vocal cords (see cord), the vibrations of which produce sounds varying in different animals according to the structure of the organs and the power which the animal possesses over them. Voice can, therefore, be found only in animals in which this svstem of respiration is developed, and the lungs and larynx (or syrinx) actually exist. Fishes, having no lnngs, are dumb, as far as true vocal utterance is concerned, though various noises may issue from their throats (see croaker, grunt, and drum). In man the superior organization and mobility of the tongue and lips, as well as the perfection of the larynx, enable him to modify his vocal sounds to an almost infinite extent. In ordinary speaking the tones of the voice have nearly all the same pitch, and the variety of the sounds is due rather to the action of the mouth-organs than to definite movements of the glottis and vocal cords. In singing the successive sounds correspond more or less closely to the ideal tones of the musical scale. The male voice admits of division into tenor and bass, and the female into soprano and contralto. The lowest female tone is an octave or so higher than the lowest tone of the male voice; and the female's highest tone is about an octave above that of the male. The compass of both voices taken together is four octaves or more, the chief differences residing in the pitch and also in the timbre. In medicine, voice is the sound of utterance as transmitted through the lungs and chest-wall in auscultation. In zoology, voice is ordinarily restricted to respiratory sounds or vocal utterance, as above explained, and as distinguished from any mechanical noise, like stridulation, etc. The more usual word for the voice of any animal is cry; and the various cries, distinctive or characteristic of certain animals, take many distinctive terms, according to their vocal quality, as bark, bay, bellow, bleat, bray, cackle, call, caw, chatter, chirp, chirrup, cluck, coo, croak, crow, gabble, gobble, growl, grunt, hiss, honk, hoot, howl, low, mew, neigh, peep, pipe, purr, quack, roar, scream, screech, snarl, snort, song, squall, squawk, squeak, squeal, trumpet, twitter, warble, waul, whine, whinny, whistle, whoop, yawp, yell, yelp, and many others. The voices of some animals, as certain monkeys and large carnivores and ruminants, may be heard a mile; or more. The voice reaches its highest development, in animals other than human, in the distinctively musical class of birds, some of which, notably parrots and certain corvine and sturnoid birds, can be taught to talk intelligible speech.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "lion", "definition": "A large carnivorous feline mammal (Panthera leo, formerly Felis leo), found in Southern Asia and in most parts of Africa, distinct varieties occurring in the different countries.

Malignant tumors growby infiltration and destruction of the surrounding tissues, and are characterized by a tendency to recur after removal, by the property of spreading to other parts of the body by a process of dissemination known as metastasis, and by producing a general disturbance of health termed cachexia. From the standpoint, of the pathologist two chief groups of cancerous tumors are recognized: the carcinomata, or true cancers, and the sarcomata. The fundamental difference between these two is the fact that carcinoma originates in the epithelial tissues of the body, whereas sarcoma develops from the connective tissues. This difference in origin gives rise to certain structural characteristics which enable the microscopist readily to distinguish one type from the other. Carcinoma is rare before the age of thirty; it is somewhat commoner in women than in men; and it is most often seen in the uterus, skin, breast, and stomach. Sarcoma is a disease of early adult life, is more prone to attack men than women, and is commonly found in the subcutaneous tissue, bony structures, and lymph-nodes. Carcinoma is conveyed from one part of the body to another through the lymphatic vessels, sarcoma by way of the blood-stream. In spite of an enormous amount of research devoted to this subject, the exciting cause of cancer is still unknown. The influences of heredity, climate, food, race, social condition, and local injury have all been invoked as factors concerned, but without arriving at any degree of certainty. The theory referring the developmentof malignant tumors to the presence of minute animal or vegetable organisms has numerous adherents, but it has not been definitely established, and many prominent authorities consider that the explanation is to be sought for in a disturbance of some still undiscovered fundamental law governing the growth of cells. Although it appears that cancer is increasing somewhat in frequency, the percentage of cures is increasing much more rapidly, owing to the earlier diagnoses and more thorough operations which are now possible. Extirpation by the knife as promptly and as completely as possible, when the growth is accessible, is regarded as the method of treatment that offers the greatest hope of a cure; but the employment of the X-rays or other form of radioactivity has in a number of instances given excellent results.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "triumvirate", "definition": "A party of three men; three men or three personifications in company or forming one group; also, a trio or triad of any kind.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "zo\u00f6morphism", "definition": "The conception or representation of men or supernal beings under the form of animals, or of men or gods transformed into beasts; the attribution of human or divine qualities to beings of animal form; worship of the images of animals; zo\u00f6theism.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "jinrikisha", "definition": "A small, two-wheeled, hooded vehicle drawn by one or more men.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "jockstrap", "definition": "A supporting undergarment for the external genitals worn by men engaging in vigorous athletic sports or strenuous exercise; called also athletic supporter and jock.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "jan", "definition": "One of an intermediate order between angels and men.", "gender": "male", "tags": ["wordnik"]}, {"word": "maize", "definition": "A large species of American grass of the genus Zea (Zea Mays), widely cultivated as a forage and food plant; Indian corn, commonly called corn.

They are officially divided into three groups according to the degree of their variance from orthodox beliefs and observances, as follows: I. \u201cMost obnoxious.\u201d the Judaizers; the Molokane, who refuse to recognize civil authority or to take oaths; the Dukhobortsy, or Dukhobors, who are communistic, marry without ceremony, and believe that Christ was human, but that his soul reappears at intervals in living men; the Khlysty, who countenance anthropolatory, are ascetics, practice continual self-flagellation, and reject marriage; the Skoptsy, who practice castration; and a section of the Bezpopovtsy, or priestless sect, which disbelieve in prayers for the Czar and in marriage. II. \u201cObnoxious:\u201d the Bezpopovtsy, who pray for the Czar and recognize marriage.

At an early date it was not unusual to admit young boys, even of five or six, to the office of reader, but by the sixth century the age of eighteen was required by law. In the Roman Catholic Church this order is little more than one of the steps to the priesthood. The reader (lector) ranks above a doorkeeper and below an exorcist, and the form of ordination is the delivery to him of the book from which he is to read. In the Greek church the reader (anagnost) ranks below a subdeacon, and it is his office, as it was in the early church, to read the Epistle, the deacon reading the Gospel. In the Church of England the order fell into abeyance after the Reformation, but lay readers were frequently licensed, especially in churches or chapels without a clergyman. They could not minister the sacraments and other rites of the church, except the burial of the dead and the churching of women, nor pronounce the absolution and benediction. Of late years, however, bishops have regularly admitted candidates to the office of reader by delivery of a copy of the New Testament. In the American Episcopal Church lay readers conduct services in vaeant churches or under a rector by his request with license from the bishop for a definite period (a year or less).

This is also true in the eye region. Therefore giving the impression that Asians have smaller eyes when this is not true.\r\r-Asians have small penises: FALSE! Almost all academic study and scientific research ever undertaken has proven that Asian penises are just as large as Caucasian penises. The average for both are approximately 5.5 to 6 inches. However, Asian men do not stray far from this average, whilst Caucasian men do. For every Caucasian man with a 9 inch penis, there is one with a 3 inch one. And for every Asian with a 7 inch penis, there is one with a 5 inch one. There are more Caucasians with large penises, but there are also more Caucasians with smaller penises. Yes, penises smaller than Asians. This is fact! This information has also been known for a long time, but people like to perpetuate myths.\r\r-Asians are short: This is not genetic and not necessarily true. A lot of Asians are short due to diet. It lacks protein and dairy. It is healthier and hence Asians tend to live longer, but it does not promote physical growth as much. However, for Asians with a \"Western\" diet, they tend to be just as tall, if not taller than their Caucasian counterparts. A lot of the tallest people on earth are Asian. A famous example is NBA star Yao Ming.\r\r- Asians are smart: This stereotype is actually true. Asians have one of the highest average IQ's in the world. The average Asian American IQ is approximately 120, whilst the Average Caucasian American is approximately 100. However, just like penis size, the IQ varies greatly for Caucasians and less for Asians. There is a higher percentage of Caucasians with very high IQ's (around 150) than Asians. Although for every Caucasian with an IQ of 150, there are Caucasians with an IQ of only 50.\r\r- All Asians are rich/poor: There is a stereotype that Asians are either really rich or poor third world people. Since the two conflict with each other, it is obvious that neither is true. There are rich and poor Asians, just like rich and poor White and Black people.\r\r- Asian women are submissive, subservient, sex craving, etc. Asian men are dominating, patriarchal, sexist etc: False! Asian women are given a lot of respect and power by Asian men. Asian women can also be materialistic, agressive and dominating (ask any man who has dated an Asian). Many Asian countries treat women as equals and many women keep their surnames. In Asian culture, it is generally accepted that the man does the talking in public and act gentlemanly, whilst the woman has control at home. In Western culture, it is the opposite. Caucasian women are given the impression of power in public, but is often told that the kitchen is her place at home. \"A man's home is his castle\" is a Western saying. \"Women hold up half the heavens\" is Asian. There have been no female presidents, but there have been female emperors in Asia.\r\r- All Asians are \"blah\": False. Half the world's population is Asian.

The original slang had connotations of class distinction,with the implication that bridge and tunnelers were less affluent than those living in the city and were therefore of a lower class. Because of the recent hipster revolution and the ongoing \"hipsterization\" of popular culture, over the years the term has drifted away from being a distinction based on affluence and location of residence, to a distinction based on cultural awareness, values, and attitude. In terms of the modern usage of the term, one can now reside in Manhattan and still be considered \"bridge and tunnel\".

It has featured in:\r\rThe Princess Diaries Movie (in a pretty negative form)\r\rBring It On (in a pretty positive form)\r\rThe Princess Diaries Book (in a pretty negative form to begin with, then more neutral)\r\rThe video for Nirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit.\r\r~~~\r\rOther reasons for negative impacts on Cheerleading: They can make enemies easily. You cannot live without someone hating you, for some reason. These cheerleaders who make enemies then became the sterotype.\r\r~~~\r\rOther reasons for positive impacts on Cheerleading: Popularity. It is a sad sad thing to realise, but many high schoolers in todays world care about nothing more than to be popular, although that is obviously not true for all.\r\rI have found that Popularity is based on two things: Sports and Boyfriends.\r\r\r\rTo get popular quick, girls subconciously realise these two things. The best sport possible for them is probably Cheerleading. It probably gets you a lot more attention and popularity than joining the Female Soccer Team.\r\rThen after they get onto the Cheerleading Team, they get boyfriends. And then ... BAM! They are popular.\r\rBut this doesn't always work. The girls who don't make the Cheerleading Team can become so obssessed in being popular, and when they finally realise it was pointless, they can take the blame out on the Cheerleading Team, instead of realising that they should be taking the blame out on themselves.\r\rI am not saying that all Cheerleaders are wonderful people. Popularity can make people very self-centred and unfair. Therefore Popularity links in with being a Cheerleader many many times.\r\rIn conclusion, it is unfair to say that cheerleaders are all evil sluts, but also unfair to say that they are all wonderful clever people who like doing Sport.\r\rJust in the same way that it is unfair to call Punks evil, depressing people or to say that they are the real people who know exactly what is best.\r\rLabels are a way of expression, but have lead to stereotypes everywhere. This makes high school a lot harder for everyone, but there isn't much you can do about that.\r\rIn my final conclusion, Cheerleaders are practically another label, however they do extra-sports activities after school and are hated by many.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "female"}, {"word": "cheesing", "definition": "Huffing Cat Urine.

In Miami they are called 'chongas'.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "female"}, {"word": "Chonga", "definition": "A girl of [Hispanic] origin, usually between the ages of 12 and 19, but sometimes as young as 8. Primarily found in Miami (most famously, in [Hialeah]), the chonga is known for her cheap form of dress, a combination of the so-called [gangsta]look and that of a prostitute, but can vary between the two. She wears ridiculously large hoop earrings large enough to be bracelets, which are usually gold and have their name written in them, and diamond studs high up on her ears. They may also wear thick, gold bangle bracelets in stacks on their arms. Depending on how [ghetto] she thinks she is, she may wear oversized men's t-shirts with tight, usually white Brazilian pants, with a colored thong worn underneath that shows through (on purpose). The chonga's shoe of choice is usually either the traditional black [Reeboks], white Nike [Air Force Ones], completely black [Converse] high tops, velvet black ankle boots, or the most popular, Chinese beaded slippers in the same matching color ad their top, and worn with ankle socks. Most recently, Chongas have begun listening to [reggaeton], but also enjoy rap, R&B, and the radio stations that play these genres of music. They can also be heard frequently calling these stations to make \"shout-outs\" to their [babydaddy]. Chongas have a very distinct form of speech, a cross between poorly imitated black slang and a thick Spanish accent, which emphasizes on the vowels. Some chongas even speak entirely in [Spanglish]. Here are some sample sentences, and how they would be pronounced in Chonga:\r\rEyy yu no daa kih in fahrs pihreeuh OMAIIGA daaaaaaaaaaaaam he faaeeen!(Hey, you know that kid in first period, oh my God, damn he\u0089\u00db\u00aas fine!)\r\rEyy yu go-eentu Maariisleyseesiz quinceson Fraidei?(Hey,are you going to Marisleysise\u0089\u00db\u00aas quince on Friday?)\r\rO HELLNAA bish Ima beesho azz, waash!

Oh my God!)\r\rThe Chonga  also has a distinct form of writing as well, whether it be on bathroom stalls or their Myspace pages. A typical chonga-vandalized school bathroom stall (or wall, or classroom desk, or school bus seat, or most any other form of public property) would consist of poorly imitated graffiti in permanent marker or whiteout, usually insulting a rival chonga, warning fellow chongas to \u0089\u00db\u00cfBak da Fuk Off\u0089\u00db\u009d, \u0089\u00db\u00cfclaiming\u0089\u00db\u009d a fantasy crush, (for example Nelly, Bow Wow, Chris Brown, Ludacris, Chingy Lil Wayne, Daddy Yankee, etc., referring to themselves as the rapper\u0089\u00db\u00aas \u0089\u00db\u00cfwifey\u0089\u00db\u009d or \u0089\u00db\u00cfbaby girl\u0089\u00db\u009d or \u0089\u00db\u00cffine Rican mami\u0089\u00db\u009d), or simply tagging, using nicknames such as \u0089\u00db\u00cfBaby Girl\u0089\u00db\u009d or \u0089\u00db\u00cfBrownie\u0089\u00db\u009d or \u0089\u00db\u00cfTweety\u0089\u00db\u009d or \u0089\u00db\u00cfRican Mami\u0089\u00db\u009d.

Scholars around the world maintain that this is the only known case of irony that is both situational and dramatic.\r\r\r\rContrary to popular belief, Chuck Norris is unable to send his roundhouse kicks across the fabric of time, however he IS able to perform this action across parallel dimentions and once, just for fun, roundhouse kicked his own ass.\r\r\r\rChuck Norris broke his own leg, purely for the sake of winning the special olympics.\r\r\r\rChuck Norris once went to a frat party, and proceeded to roundhouse every popped collar in sight.

To celebrate, Norris let Steven Seagal out of his cage and beat him mercilessly. Mr. T, who was also present, pitied the shit out of Segal. Norris then fucked your wife, and lit her body on fire using pure grain alcohol and bolts of lightning from his eyes.\r\r\r\rWhen Neil Armstrong uttered \"One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\" on the moon in 1969, he failed to notice Chuck Norris sitting behind him in a lawnchair, a beer in hand, until Chuck Norris gave Armstrong a swift roundhouse kick to the face.

Although many people think that those with depression have experienced huge tramas in their lives, this is not necessarily the case.  Depression is a disease, just like diabetes is a disease.  It can strike anyone, regardless of their gender, class, or social status.  I personally am attending an ivyleague college next year, was captain of my soccer team in high school, could be considered among the popular kids at my school, and have an extremely loving family. I still have the scars from my cutting, which I stopped doing 2 months ago.  Although i was lucky enough to be able to stop, other people such as my older sister, became addicted.

Note: Do not confuse this with a much broader range of stupid looking, messy on purpose hair, usually belonging to a [scenester].\r\n\r\n1b. If the hair is not ridiculously greasy and/or black, the hair is preened in some ridiculously outdated and hideous style, that, again, must cover at least 60% of the face.\r\n\r\n2. Girl's jeans. My personal theory is that they wear these pants to accentuate their genitalia, but as we all know that emo fags never have any use for their genitalia\r\n\r\n3a. A very tight argyle sweater, even in the summer time.\r\n\r\n3b. A very tight T-shirt, maybe a girl's \"babydoll\" T-shirt, usually adorned with a picture of a band that is very hard to listen to.\r\n\r\n4. Extreme skinniness, not natural thinness, but more of an emaciated form, almost as if they are too sad to eat.\r\n\r\n5. An uncomfortable looking scarf, even in hot weather. Usually in some ironic, plaid or striped pattern.\r\n\r\n6. (Optional) Trite box-frame glasses, used to make said emo fag look intellectual. In many cases, these glasses are non-prescription. If in any event you discover that an emo fag you see is wearing glasses they do not need, it is policy to grab and destroy these, preferrably in  front of him and his emo fag friends.\r\n\r\n7. Converse All-Star shoes, mainly black (and sometimes they will spend extra money to get the kind with black rubber), but some presistent emo fags will go out of their way to purchase this style of shoe in some garish pastel color off the Internet. They will 9 times out of 10 be in pristine condition (due to having 15 pairs), save for some Sharpie markings, usually some band name, or ridiculous lyrics.\r\n\r\n8. A black leather belt with some form of metal stud worn around the beltline, but stupidly enough not threaded through the belt loops.\r\n\r\n9. (Optional) Cliche tattoos/piercings, including a Cal Star (aka Nautical Star), lobe plugs (usually not ridiculously big like those body mod freakshows who don't like dealing with that pesky job market), barbed wire. Note: Some emo fags are too young to get piercings or tattoos, so they just tell everyone about what they're going to get.

They are usually sad most of the time, do not smile very often, and just like emo boys, show no signs of self worth or self confidence whatsoever and will not make eye contact with you. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn emo girl has very dark hair, either cut somewhere around their shoulder, or in the classic emo haircut, which is sort of short and spiky in the back with long sweeping bangs in the front.  Their hair has to be very dark brown or black, or in some cases very light blonde as long as the cut is right.  No matter what, it must be worn so that it is covering part of their face at all times.  This is because emo girls tend to be shy and mysterious and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really want their face to show too much.

The morning after you and a babe, who was formerly \"just a friend\", go at it, the fact that you're feeling weird and guilty is no reason not to jump on her again before there is a discussion about what a big mistake it was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n39.

If a bet is made, and the challenge is completed, then the bettor may recoup his money by immediately completing a more daring challenge. If he refuses the challenge or chooses not to propose one, then and only then, must the money be paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n52. Masturbate often. (exception: if your roommate is due back within the hour)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n53.

A man's shoes may not intentionally match any other article of clothing on his body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n55. No comment shall ever be made to a man about how much he is sweating.

The greatest concentrations of hipsters can be found living in the Williamsburg, Wicker Park, and Mission District neighborhoods of major cosmopolitan centers such as New York, Chicago, and San Francisco respectively.  Although \"hipsterism\" is really a state of mind,it is also often intertwined with distinct fashion sensibilities. Hipsters reject the culturally-ignorant attitudes of mainstream consumers, and are often be seen wearing vintage and thrift store inspired fashions, tight-fitting jeans, old-school sneakers, and sometimes thick rimmed glasses.  Both hipster men and women sport similar androgynous hair styles that include combinations of messy shag cuts and asymmetric side-swept bangs.  Such styles are often associated with the work of creative stylists at urban salons, and are usually too \"edgy\" for the culturally-sheltered mainstream consumer.  The \"effortless cool\" urban bohemian look of a hipster is exemplified in Urban Outfitters and American Apparel ads which cater towards the hipster demographic. Despite misconceptions based on their aesthetic tastes, hipsters tend to be well educated and often have liberal arts degrees, or degrees in maths and sciences, which also require certain creative analytical thinking abilities.  Consequently many hipsters tend to have jobs in the music, art, and fashion industries.  It is a myth that most hipsters are unemployed and live off of their parent's trust funds.   \r\n\r\n     Hipsters shun mainstream societal conventions that apply to dating preferences and traditional \"rules\" of physical attraction.  It is part of the hipster central dogma not to be influenced by mainsream advertising and media, which tends to only promote ethnocentric ideals of beauty.  The concepts of androgyny and feminism have influenced hipster culture, where hipster men are often as thin as the women they date. The muscular and athletic all-American male ideal is not seen as attractive by confident and culturally-empowered hipster women who instead view them as symbols of male oppression, sexism, and misogyny.  Likewise, culturally-vapid sorority-type girls with fake blond hair, overly tanned skin, and \"Britney Spears tube-tops\" are not seen as attractive by cultured hipster males who instead see them as symbols of female insecurity, low self-esteem, and lack of cultural intelligence and independent thinking.  Hipsters are also very racially open-minded, and the greatest number of interracial couples in any urban environment are typically found within the hipster subculture.  \r\n\r\n     Although hipsters are technically conformists within their own subculture, in comparison to the much larger mainstream mass, they are pioneers and leaders of the latest cultural trends and ideals.  For example, the surge of jeans made to look old and worn (i.e. \"distressed\"), that have become prevalent at stores such as The Gap, American Eagle, Abercrombie and Fitch, and Hollister, were originally paraded by hipsters who shopped in thrift stores years before such clothing items were mass produced and sold to the mainstream consumer.  The true irony here is that many of the detractors of hipster culture are in fact unknowingly following a path that hipsters have carved out years before them.  This phenomena also applies to music as well, as many bands have become successful and known to mainstream audiences only because hipsters first found and listened to them as early-adopters of new culture.  Once certain concepts of fashion and music have reached mainstream audiences, hipsters move on to something new and improved.\r\n\r\n     Because of the rise of various online photo-blog and social networking sites, insights into urban hipster culture is reaching sheltered suburban audiences at an exponential rate.  Cultural \"norms\" have been deconstructed by hipster culture as a whole. Hipsterism is often dismissed as just an image thing by some, but the culture as a whole is effecting changes in society, leading to feelings of insecurity and resentment in people who are no longer a part of the cultural ruling class. For example, a lot of anti-hipster sentiment evidently comes from culturally-clueless suburban frat boy types who feel that the more sensitive, intelligent, and culturally aware hipster ideal threatens their insecure sense of masculinity.  Anti-hipster sentiment often comes from people who simply can't keep up with social change and are envious of those who can.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "female"}, {"word": "hoes", "definition": "fine-ass,dick-sucking,cock-loving females.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "female"}, {"word": "hoe", "definition": "1.

Iowa is a national leader in education (students in many other states including Texas take the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, and everyone's heard of the ACT, based in Iowa City) and is leading the way in biofuels to reduce the nation's dependence on oil.  To dispel the ignorance displayed elsewhere on this post, here's a state breakdown of cities and topography.  If seventy synonyms for boobs is alright to post, so is this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCentral Iowa:  [Des Moines], located at the intersection of I-80 and I-35, is the largest city with a metro of a half million and is the state capital, second only to London for the title of insurance capital of the world.  [Ames] (80,000 metro) is about a half hour north of Des Moines and is home to [Iowa State University], a land grant school of 30,000 respected around the world for its engineering and agricultural programs.  Central Iowa is, outside of river vallies, very flat, and outside of the Des Moines area and Ames is very sparsely populated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEastern Iowa:  The most densely populated area of the state.  Ethnically diverse [Iowa City] (115,000 metro) was Iowa's first state capital, was the first city in the world to elect a female mayor, has been named the most cultured city per capita in the nation, is always in the top five cities in the country for education, and is home to the [University of Iowa], 30,000, nationally renowned for its Carver College of Medicine and Iowa Hawkeye athletics.  The music departments of Iowa City's two large public high schools have won a total of five Grammy awards.  [Cedar Rapids], (200,000 metro) just twenty minutes north of Iowa City in the beautiful Cedar River valley, is the second largest single city, is the economic hub of eastern Iowa, has two private colleges, and is best known for being the place you get any of your Quaker Oats brand ceral from.  [Waterloo/Cedar Falls], two conjoined cities (130,000 metro) is where the [Unviersity of Northern Iowa], 18,000, is located.  The [Quad Cities], (375,000 metro) two in Iowa and two in Illinois, straddle the Mississippi and form the largest metro between Des Moines and Chicago.  The largest of the four cities is [Davenport], IA, home to the Bix 7 foot race whose hilly course and large prize attract runners from every part of the globe.  [Dubuque], (90,000 metro) on the Mississippi where Iowa meets Illinois and Wisconsin, is Iowa's oldest city. It is home to a ton of beautiful architecture, four private colleges, a far-reaching ELCA Lutheran seminary, and the Smithsonion affiliated National Mississippi River Musem and Aquarium.  Eastern Iowa's topography is for the most part very rolling farmland, with the exception of the hillier Iowa river valley, Cedar river valley, and the bluffs and hills skirting the whole eastern border along the Mississippi.  The northeast corner of the state is all bluffland, home to small town Decorah and reputed Luther College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWestern Iowa:  The vast majority of Iowa west of I-35 is flat farmland with the exception of the very westernmost strip.  [Sioux City] on the Missouri river (the western border) is a good sized city with nice amenities and lots of historyt.  [Council Bluffs] is the largest suburb of Omaha, just across the river in Nebraska.  The Iowa Great Lakes region contains many large lakes, most notably lake Okoboji, one of only three blue water lakes in the world.  The Loess Hills state park runs along the whole westernmost strip of the state, and offers lots of hilly hiking and some of the state's largest forests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIowa's motto should be \"Iowa: Not as bad as you picture it.\"", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "female"}, {"word": "Irene", "definition": "A crazy, fun person that doesn't care what people think of her.

Like everyone else, it all falls under personal preference. Sex is really such a personal and intimate act that no one answer would fit for everyone, but here are a few particulars to consider ... \r\n\r\nBODIES. We sometimes forget that the entire body is an erogenous zone. Sensitive areas include the face, ears, neck, arms, chest, belly, back, butt, and thighs, back of knees, calves, feet and toes. The entire body can be used to excite a woman. Rubbing bodies together, feeling erect nipples or moist pubic area can excite with subtle motions. \r\n\r\nFINGERS. Fingers can be delightful to use on those women who enjoy penetration (not all women do). Some women appreciate long, thin fingers while others like the feel of short, strong fingers. No matter what the preference, all women appreciate clean, short, well-filed nails. \r\n\r\nHANDS. Running hands up and down a lover's body will often elicit electric responses of passion. From light caresses down the back to deep rubbing across the butt, caressing is an important aspect to sex. Caressing often turns to gentle pinching or tugging at nipples. Lightly running fingers in a tickling motion across the belly and sides will excite many women. Once excitement has built, slipping fingers into the vagina or rubbing against the clitoris will often bring a woman to orgasm. \r\n\r\nMOUTH. Kissing is a good place to begin and a very important part of sex. Kisses come in different styles depending on the person, the mood and the moment. Tiny, soft kisses tantalize and intrigue. Deep, open-mouth kisses with tongues entwined convey a depth of passion and longing. Kisses are appropriate for any part of the body, wherever one feels the urge to place them, lightly or with trailing tongues. Gently nibbling or sucking on nipples excites some women, and some women can reach orgasm just from breast arousal. It is important to note reactions to these stimulations as some women dislike having their breasts touched at all. Gently nibbling or sucking on a responsive clitoris is enjoyed by most women and most often results in orgasm.\r\n\r\nPELVIC AREA. Some women can reach orgasm by rubbing pelvic areas together or against a lover's leg. This can be done with one partner on top or two women side-to-side.\r\n\r\nANAL SEX. Anal sex can include anilingus (licking the anus) and/or penetration. Penetration can be done with a finger or fingers, dildo or butt plug. Some women love anal sex, others do not. Like everything else, it's all personal preference. \r\n\r\nDILDOS, VIBRATORS & BUTT PLUGS. (Or objects used to vaginal or anal penetration). Some women use dildos and/or butt plugs some do not. Some use them occasionally; some use them all the time. Dildos come in many different shapes, colors and sizes. Some are shaped as corncobs, fists, dolphins or fingers. Some have attachments to stimulate the clitoris during penetration and some have two ends to stimulate two women at one time. It's all personal preference. \r\n\r\nFISTING. Fisting is penetrating a woman's vagina with your entire hand. Fisting requires a lot of concentration and caution. I recommend Hand In The Bush: The Fine Art of Vaginal Fisting, by Deborah Addington, if you want to learn the proper how-to on fisting. \r\n\r\nMUTUAL MASTURBATION. Many women enjoy mutual masturbation. Lying while facing each other, simultaneously rubbing and touching each other's clitoris can be educational as well as enjoyable.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "female"}, {"word": "lesbiauntie", "definition": "The female equivalent of a Guncle.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "female"}, {"word": "lesbi-friends", "definition": "Two women that are very close friends that practically seem like they are [lesbians].", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "female"}, {"word": "lesbro", "definition": "1.

Some manga are pornographic, but that's just a small percentage of manga.\r\n\r\nManga, in Japanese, means \"flowing words\" or \"Undisciplined words\". It is an ancient art that has been used for centuries as a form of entertainment. It's basicallt Japanese comic books, which can be easily translated to English. However, just saying manga are comics from Japan is wrong.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, in the US and in Europe, most comics are addressed to young children between the ages of 9 and 13. That is not the case of manga. There are 6-7 major types of manga, each having its own audience. Kodomo manga is for children. Shonen manga is for boys ages 12-18 , Shoujo manga is for gilrs age 12-18. Josei manga is for adult ladies above the age of 20, mainly working women. Seinen manga is for young men between the ages of 18 and 30, and Hentai manga is pornographic, adult manga.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, saying \"comics from Japan\" is wrong. Another difference between manga and Western comics is that each comics volume has its own plot, while manga volumes all follow the same plot. The artwork is VERY different. Manga has its own particular artwork, especially when it comes to human faces, particularly the eyes, chin, nose, mouth, forehead... Manga is also read from RIGHT to LEFT. (Yes, even the English ones).\r\n\r\nIn Japan, 40% of all book & magazine sales are manga. That's a huge number, considering the Japanese read A LOT.

He believes women are beautiful, innocent angels and men are filthy animals who need to be controlled.\n\nManginas see women as the ultimate being and place them on a pedestal, focusing only on sex or the satisfaction of women all the while not giving a damn about his fellow man.

A female [fanfiction] character who is so perfect as to be annoying. The male equivlalent is the [Marty-Stu]. Often abbreviated to \"Sue\". A Mary Sue character is usually written by a beginning author. Often, the Mary Sue is a self-insert with a few \"improvements\" (ex. better body, more popular, etc). The Mary Sue character is almost always beautiful, smart, etc... In short, she is the \"perfect\" girl. The Mary Sue usually falls in love with the author's favorite character(s) and winds up upstaging all of the other characters in the book/series/universe. There are several main types of Mary Sue: \r\n\r\nVictim!Sues: The Victim!Sue is your whiny, wimpy, pathetic female character who can't seem to do much of anything except cry and get herself into trouble that the romantic interest of the fic has to rescue her from. \r\n\r\nWarrior!Sues: The Warrior!Sue is usually loud, obnoxious and (of course) an amazing warrior. She'll usually have some tragic past that led her to become a warrior, and she'll upstage all of the [Canonical] characters with her mad Sueish powerz. \r\n\r\nMage!Sue: Similar to the Warrior!Sue, the Mage!Sue has amazing stregnth in magic, or has a magical power that nobody else has. She'll usually wind up upstaging all of the magical characters of the series.\r\n\r\nPunk!Sue: Also called Noncomformist!Sue or Goth!Sue, the Punk!Sue is usually written by female beginners in the 11-15 age group. The Punk!Sue is loud, obnoxious, annoying and generally the type of person who you'd want to send off to boot camp for six months. The Punk!Sue almost always has angst coming out of her ears and isn't really a bad person, she's just oh!-so-angry at whatever tragic past the author has chosen to give her. The Punk!Sue is based on what the 11-15 year old author thinks is \"cool\" and wishes she could be. This includes Evil!Sues.\r\n\r\nMisfit!Sue: This includes all Sues who are supposedly geeks, nerds, misfits, etc. Usually, the Misfit!Sue doesn't start out as inhumanly beautiful, but winds up getting a makeover and finding out she had the potential to be a guy-magnet (or girl-magnet, depending on the genre) all along. Also includes the \"My parents want me to do this but I want to do that and it's not fair!!one!\" type of Sue. Usually, this Sue is very bookish and smart, but will find some sort of physical talent nobody expected and become a star as a result.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note is that a Sue will usually have a completely off-the-wall name, like \"Viquetoria\". The more wierd and pretentious the name of the character, the more likely it is that she's a Sue.\r\n\r\nFinally, Sues often have wierd, improbable or impossible bloodlines.

Part of their success as a boy band was that they recognized themselves as a boy band and didn't take themselves too seriously. Upon realizing that the popularity of generic pop music and boy bands in general was dying off by the 2000's (at least in the US) Justin Timberlake (the most talented all around member of the group) broke out of the group and went solo coming out with his own successful album.

Hated by the majority of universities in the state, TxState boasts the prettiest campus, best location, and rocking partying reputation. UT and A&M love to say that TxState students couldn't get into their schools, but seeing as the requirements to attend TxState are the exact same requirements as UT, it really just proves the point that we don't like to hang with goats fuckers, Wrangler lovers, or ugly theater kids who pretend UT is Ivy League.\n\nWhy Texas State? Texas State hosts the kids you loathed in high school. We had the nicest cars, parents money, and the nicest bodies. It's not our fault that we would like to congregate at the same school and bask in our awesomeness. Are we vain? Shallow? Fuck yeah we are, and we have the absolute right to be. You may hate us because we party harder, rock tighter bodies, and will STILL get better jobs than you because even if we're here for six years, we can network like the fucking best.\n\nHave any doubts? Other universities TRAVEL to party with our school's elite. River Raft Race in one of the biggest parties nationally, with over 2,000 participants this past year alone. People come from Arizona, Colorado, New Jersey, and even California to see what the fuck we're about for just one weekend.\n\nStill hate our school? Then don't even bother heading out to 6th street in Austin, because we've been dominating that party scene for two decades. UT got biggest party school in 2006? You better believe it's because TxState reigns supreme in their own city, and while they may got the books, we've got the looks. We turn the state capital into our own personal Vegas every weekend, and nobody stands in our way. We even come in limos and top-notch party buses, while all you UT fags take sad little taxis.\n\nYour school thinks it has money? Coach bags are our gym bags, and you'll be laughed out if you think Sperry's are expensive shoes.\n\nWhy do we get the greatest jobs? Because our parents are the CEOs, lawyers, and doctors of this fine state. We've gone head-to-head with board members well before this college game, and we make a point to be remembered. Our school has the biggest entrepreneurial spirit and we are feisty; our ego is what powers our greatness.\n\nJealous much? You should be. Sam Houston and Stephen F. Austin only wish to have the caliber we do, and UT and A&M simply just don't know what to do. It's not their fault, how can you compete with a school that's the perfect mesh of street smarts, great looks, and trust funds?\n\nPartying is just part of our nature. We have a fucking BAR in the student center on campus. The only reason you hate is because WE are living the American dream. We toke, roll, yay it out all day because we can and still rape a good GPA.\n\nYou think we're immature and don't want to grow up? Why? Because our parents pay for everything? You're right, it crazy of us to take advantage of the BMWs, boats, Range Rovers, shopping allowances and free trips to Miami and Vegas. Sorry our parents don't want us to work at McDonalds and live on loans. We're not immature, we're spoiled, gifted really, and fuck yeah we're going to enjoy the ride. Maybe if you lost a few pounds and got a tan, we'd let you come along too.\n\nAnd forget about the freshman fifteen, we don't tolerate that here. If you're not a gym rat, just pack your bags. We only socialize with the hottest, and that takes maintenance. So we tan, we work out, we dye, we bleach. You say our girls look like Playboy models? Well, incidentally, we've got those too, just watch the Girls Next Door. Just keep talking about our bleached hair while we average a 168 LSAT score and and starting salary of 70,000.\n\nAnd our boys are just as fabulous. They're built and hot, tan and taunt, they're a girl's fantasy. Our fraternity formals are legendary, and these boys use their street smarts in every way. They own the nicest bars and clubs from Miami to Cancun. They hold more boardroom positions than A&M after graduation, probably because we don't look like Joe Dirt. MTV pleads to film on location here every year, we just can't help that we're that awesome.\n\nSo anyone jealous, just step aside. Go cry how we're spoiled, shallow, and dumb as dirt. You're just upset because you were too pathetic to be invited to the party, it's not our fault we won the genetic lottery.

The replicas can be upgraded by opening it up, and changeing various parts in order to achieve the effect desired. Most fields have an FPS limit, usually 400fps for automatic and semi-automatic firing replicas, and 550fps for single-shot bolt action rifles. \r\rMost replicas used on field are either Gas powered or electric powered. \r\rThe electric powered ones use a battery that runs a motor, that turns a set of gears, which in turn cranks back a spring, which pulls back on a piston , which then raises the amount of air in the cylinder, which is all released at once raising the pressure behind the bb in the chamber which propels the bb down the barrel, all at the pull of the trigger. The gas replicas use ozone-friendly HFC-134a(weakest) or HFC22(strongest) to propel the bb down the barrel. The gas is stored in a resivior in the magazine(ammo storage) of the replica. Spring powered replicas use manual cocking of the piston in order to raise the amount of air in the cylinder behind the bb which is all released at once, raising the amount of air pressure behind the bb propeling it foward and down the barrel.\r\rMilitary style tactics and dress are often used to the advantage of the player, which is why this game is often reffered to as \"Mil-Sim(military simulation).

A person who lacks belief in a [god] or gods.  People who use this definition categorize atheists as either negative (or implicit or weak) atheists or positive (or explicit or strong) atheists.  Negative atheists, while they don't believe in a god, do not positively assert that no gods exist.  Positive atheists, however, do.\r\r\r\r2.) A person who believes that no god or gods exist.\r\r\r\rThose who consider themselves atheists (who are usually positive atheists) tend to define 'atheist' using the former definition, and those who believe in a god or gods tend to define 'atheist' using the latter.  In both cases, this seems to be a demagogic practice intended to classify either as many or as few people as atheists as possible.  Negative atheists are usually referred to as [agnostic]s.\r\r\r\rWhile neither definition of atheism entails any personality traits of atheists or of those who do believe in a god or gods (sometimes referred to as '[theist]s'), both atheists and theists tend to believe that certain traits apply to all atheists/theists.  Common myths about atheists include: all atheists are arrogant, immoral, rebellious, and/or intolerant; all atheists really believe in (the Christian) God and are simply in denial; all atheists are depressed and believe life is meaningless.  Common myths about theists include: all theists are naive and/or intolerant; all theists don't really believe in their god(s) and just pretend to because they're afraid that if people realised that no god exists, there will be complete chaos; all theists are weak and look to their god(s) for comfort.  It hardly needs to be said that while these myths apply to a select few individuals in each group, the claim that they apply to every atheist or every theist is false.\r\r\r\rNegative atheists justify their lack of belief in god(s) by pointing out that no evidence exists for the existence of god(s), and justify their lack of disbelief by pointing out that no evidence exists for the nonexistence thereof.  Positive atheists often assert that while no evidence for god(s) exists, it should be by default assumed that they do not, until evidence is found.  Some also try to use [logic] to prove that God does not exist, but this is often attached by theists and weak atheists as being mere wordplay.  Some theists and weak atheists also assert that logic is superficial and meaningless (which is an easily refutable claim), and that only one's inner feelings can lead them to truth.  Some positive atheists (and [deist]s), however, are led to their stance through their feelings.  Some feel that because the world is filled with evil and malice, and all-loving, benevolent god cannot exist.  Those who are led to their stance through this feeling, however, cannot justify their disbelief in a malevolent god in the same way.

All that I write are historical facts.\r\r\r\rPalestine was the name of the country between the Jordan river on the east, the Sinai desert on the south and the territory of Lebanon on the North. The name of the country came from the name of the ancient powerful nation that lived in it in the time of the Bible, Plishtim.\r\rThrough the history, the country was ruled by many differant empires troughout the ages like the Romans, the Bizanties, the Saracens, the Crusadersand, and the Ottoman empire. (and NOT just \"ruled by Arabs for 1000 years\" like some one before me said).\r\rUntil the year 1918, the country was ruled (for 400 years) by the Ottoman empire. In 1918, Britanny conquered Palestine and started ruling it as a Mandate (temporary government that is meant to prepare the land under its control for independant national government).\r\rIn the ending of the 19th century, the \"Zionist organisation\" was formed by European Jews, and, because of the wake of Jewish nationalism, started searching for territorial answers for \"the problem of the Jews, a nation without a country\". One of the answers was, very obviously, Palestine (also named Zion for Jerusalem), which Jews saw for centuries as their true land, where they were banished from, and dreamed of returning to. This started a great wave of immigration to Palestine, that increased troughout the beginning of the 20th century.\r\r\r\rUnlike what someone here said, the Palastinians were NOT always a nation. In fact, for years in Palastine lived Arab peasants, almost all of them uneducated. They saw themselves as Arabs, muslims who lived in Palestine, and had no nationalistic identity.\r\rIf you want the truth, Palestini nationalism awakened only in the 1920's. This, is when more educated Palastini Arabs realised that the Jews are intending to take over Palestine (with the massive immigration and purchasing of land), and the Mufti (religious Muslim leader) Haj Amil el-Huseini decided to take action:\r\rHe declared that the Jews want to take over the el-Aktza mosque, immediatly gaining the support of Muslim countries and turning the nationalistic war into a religious war. That immediatly increased the [anti-cemitism] in Arab countries.\r\r\r\rThe nationalistic struggle increased towards the 40's, and keeps going until today. However, the wake of Palestini nationality happened too late- when they started real fighting, there were more Jews in Palestine than Arabs.\r\r\r\rI would like to add another fact: In 1947, there was a vote in the UN, and it was declared officially that in Palestine two states would be formed: A Jewish country, and an Arab country. A year later, a Jewish county called Israel was formed. However, a Palastinian country was not formed UNTIL TODAY, in spite of the fact they were given many opportunities to do so.\r\r\r\rAlso, about the six-day war: it is a terrible rude lie to claim that Israel was losing. In fact, the war was so well planned, that in the first day of war all of the Egyptian and Yardeneese airforce was destroyed. Israel did not want to go to this war, but the Arab countries were gaining too much power and put Israel in danger. Israel also tried  convincing Jordan not to join, but it refused, losing many territories. The six day war was a complete defeat to Syria, Egypt and Jordan, and the USA had nothing to do with it.\r\rEgypt and Syria, however, took revenge for their loss in 67 six years later, when they attacked Israel in 73, causing Israel great loses in men and millitary power. However, even this war, Israel managed to win. \r\r\r\rI am not trying to take either one's side, all I am saying are facts, and the fact is: The Jews rule Israel now, while the Palastinians can't do anything about it. Nothing at all. True, Israel does not do anything it can to help the Palastinians, but take into account again the fat that the Jews formed a country long ago, while the Palastinians didn't. \r\rIs it because they can't? No. It is only because they don't want to.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "pfft", "definition": "1.An expression of a lack of interest in another persons comment\r\r2.Used to look down upon another", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "premake", "definition": "the original version of a song that another band has made a remake of, often used in a sarcastic manner", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "professional student", "definition": "Person who receives multiple degrees and keeps taking courses instead of holding a profession related to the degrees earned.

Its subjects are usually romantic; especially prevalent are tales of heartbreak and sadness. In fact, the original term used to name the genre used to be \"amargue\" (\"bitterness,\" or \"bitter music\"), until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term bachata became popular.\r\r\r\rBachata grew out of - and is still closely related to - the pan Latin-American romantic style called bolero. Over time, it has been influenced by merengue - a fast paced danceable music also native to the Dominican Republic - and by a variety of Latin American guitar styles.\r\r\r\rThe music itself is played in 4/4. The most recognizable aspect of bachata instrumentation is the use of an amplified guitar (either electric or acoustic) whose sound has been doctored with a flanger, reverb, echo, or a combination of the three. The use of arpeggiated chords as the basis for the melody is almost standard. An additional guitar, usually mixed at a lower volume, may be used to provide a basic backbeat, although an electric bass guitar may be used instead. The use of bongo drums as to provide both syncopation and occasional percusive accents is also a feature of bachata; bongo solos during chorus breaks in bachata songs are rather common.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "Back Door Braggart", "definition": "n.

These principles were most notably [pwned] in Adam Smith's treatise, The Wealth of Nations (1776), in which he opposed the prevailing theory of mercantilism. Capitalism has existed in a limited form in the economies of all [hood]s, but its modern importance dates at least from the Industrial Revolution  that began in the 18th century, when bankers, merchants, [playa]s and industrialists (the bourgeoisie) began to displace landowners in political, economic, and social importance, particularly in Great Britain. Capitalism stresses freedom of individual economic enterprise; however, government action has been and is required to curb its [playa-hating], which have ranged from slavery (particularly in Britain and the United States), [haxors](In [Diablo] and [CS servers]), and apartheid (in South Africa) to monopoly cartels and financial fraud. Capitalism does not presuppose a specific form of social or political organization-type [shit]: the democratic socialism of the Scandinavian states, the consensus politics of Japan, and the state-sponsored rapid industrial growth of South Korea while under military [pwnage] all coexist with capitalism.

In the United States, it exists in the form of subsidies, tax credits, incentives, free hours of [AOL], and other types of exemptions. Though private production plays a major role in the economies of Germany and Japan, both nations have centrally planned industrial policies in which bankers, industrialists, [playa]s, [pimp]s, [ho]s and labor unions meet and seek to agree to wage policies and interest rates; these countries reject the idea of letting the [bling] wholly determine the economy. The collapse of the Soviet Union and its [fugly] states in Eastern Europe (1989-91) left those countries with a heavy burden, much [shit], and an uncertain future, representing a substantial retreat in the power of capitalism's traditional economic opponent, [socialism].

On the way to Candy Mountain, the pink and blue unicorn get guidance from the magical liopleurodon, which is a dinosaur that speaks an unidentifiable language, which Charlie can't understand. After getting directions from the liopleurodon, the pink and blue unicorns lead Charlie to a bridge, which is \"like covered in splinters.\" After crossing the bridge, Charlie and the other two unicorns arrive at Candy Mountain. Although the pink and blue unicorns beg Charlie to go inside the Candy Mountain cave, he refuses to enter. The two unicorns then get help from the letters C, A, N, D, and Y. Letter Y serenades Charlie with a song about Candy Mountain, while the other four letters dance along to the catchy tune. When the song ends, the letters spontaneously combust. Charlie was persuaded by the dancing letters and his annoying pink and blue friends to go inside the Candy Mountain cave. While entering the cave, Charlie's friends give him a smug goodbye, and he suddenly becomes concerned. Just as he tries to back out, the cave entrance closes. Charlie struggles to find his way in the dark as he starts hearing footsteps. Some fighting sound effects are heard, and in the next scene, Charlie wakes up in the meadow with a huge, bleeding gash across his lower abdomen.

For some reason, part of the Keywork comes loose, threatening a cataclysmic disaster for the universe. Coheed and Cambria are \"Guardians of the Keywork\" and Coheed is sent to a distant planet to repair the damage. Apparently, Coheed is the only person capable of doing this.\r\r\r\rUnfortunately, someone has injected a serum, called the 'Monstar virus,' into Coheed's body. Once activated, the Monstar leads to a disaster of apocolyptic proportions for mankind. However, the Monstar can only be activated by introducing a liquid called 'the ciache' into the host's bloodstream, and then making eye contact with the trigger counterpart (presumably, Cambria). Coheed has passed a form of the virus, known as the Sinstar virus, onto his four children: Josephine, Claudio, Matthew, and Mariah. The Sinstar virus will destroy the universe if activated, and is activated by a host reaching their 23rd birthday. The Sinstar also has no cure (unlike the Monstar). A general named Mayo Deftinwolf relays this information on to Coheed and urges him to kill his four children before the Sinstar takes effect.\r\r\r\rCoheed succeeds in this mission by poisioning Matthew and Mariah, and doing away with Josephine as well. However, Claudio somehow survives, and now has the charge of saving the universe from the Monstar, which has been activated in Coheed. Coheed and Cambria are now dead, as the Monstar has taken over Coheed's body. Cambria's cause of death has not been revealed as of yet.\r\r\r\rMeanwhile, a huge war has broken out on Earth. The war may or may not be related to the Keywork's problems, but things aren't looking too good. Claudio tells the story of his love for Newo Ikkin, and his defection from the army to be with her.

Other bands such as Aggression, Death, Necrophagia, Nun Slaughter, Slaughter Lord and even Slayer contributed to the movement.  What defined death metal was the fact that it was basically an exaggerated form of thrash--everything from the vocals (which transformed into a mix of growling, grunting and rasping) to the drumming was made harsher and heavier than before.  The music itself became somewhat anti-rhythmic, and in some cases experimental (as seen with Darkthrone's Goatlord album, or the modern technicality of Necrophagist).  The first bands to really modernize the movement included Autopsy, Cannibal Corpse, the virtually unkown Necrovore, Morbid Angel, Obituary, and Ripping Corpse, among others.  Death metal could range from the blood and gore horror imagery of Cannibal Corpse, to the satanic overtones of Deicide, to the political statements carried by Dying Fetus.  Some criticize death metal as they feel the musicians do nothing but randomly band their instruments.

The country must grow and the implied goal of any fascist nation is to rule the world, and have every human submit to the government.\r\n\r\n3.\"Nothing against the state\".  Any type of questioning the government is not to be tolerated.  If you do not see things our way, you are wrong.  If you do not agree with the government, you cannot be allowed to live and taint the minds of the rest of the good citizens.\r\n\r\nThe use of militarism was implied only as a means to accomplish one of the three above principles, mainly to keep the people and rest of the world in line.  Fascist countries are known for their harmony and lack of internal strife.  There are no conflicting parties or elections in fascist countries.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "fascist", "definition": "1. Someone who believes in a totalitarian state rule by a supreme leader (dictator) who controls everything possible and treats people harshly -- to gain the leader's own success,* to foment an aggressive military nationalism, and to promote a Social Darwinist belief that hard life strengthens the state by weeding out the weak. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. A lesser authority (corporation, mayor, cop, boss, parent) who legally issues harsh, burdensome, micro-managing, insensitive, or uncaring orders -- especially when they know, or should know, that their goals can be accomplished with more autonomy and much less hardship or distress. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. A harsh and probably murderous kind of dictator; a \"fascist dictator\" as opposed to a \"benign dictator\".  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. If applied unfairly, a parent authority who is doing their job within reason, but their teen either doesn't agree with their agenda (10 PM curfew to help perform well in morning school), or is insincerely asserting their parent to be a harsh disciplinarian, in order to bond socially with friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. If capitalized, is the name of the historic Italian Fascist political party. Benito Mussolini (Il Duce - \"The Leader\") was the Fascist founder and Prime Minister from 1922 to 1943, who built a cult of personality around himself using false media propaganda that he was always right, killed those relatively few unbrainwashed who opposed him, and unified Italy for an incompetent war to retake much of the old Roman empire. Apologists encapsulated their approval of his social control-freakery in the saying, \"Il Duce made the trains run on time\". \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"fascist\" connotates an official form of antisocial behavior, if society is understood to have valid comfort needs not met by a harsh authoritarian work ethic or supervision style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"fascist\" has general application to the misuse of hierarchical power in government, business, and religion, as well as to all other levels of society.  As the global population increases, it will continue as one of the future's most important social issues. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"fascist\" behavior can be observed in some form in everyday life, but is especially obvious on TV when ordered by right-wing politicians, mean bosses, and greedy corporations. Parents can be both fairly or unfairly labeled, because some parents are minor fascists, yet teens can't always tell what is fascist over-control, from what is just good parenting. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNear-synonyms: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany folks should have said \"fascist\", if they misused \"nazi\" in poor taste, since the latter is properly reserved for genocide and extermination concerns only. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"fascist\" is different from \"racist\", though racists are often fascists as well. But there are several nation-state military examples where the races have worked together to control the population in arguably fascist or at least military styles. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnwary citizens can be duped by two-faced \"cryptofascist\" policies. For example, people in a dangerous neighborhood might accept a policy of police searching all houses for weapons. But the real purpose of the searches might be to locate books supporting the political opposition, and to intimidate or arrest people found nearby. Mussolini was the original cryptofascist, because he started his political life as a Socialist, and then turned against his former political friends when he came into power as a Fascist.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "fashionmista", "definition": "The male version of the fashionista.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA man who loves fashion.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "fat joe", "definition": "Fat Joe is the only non-black person in the universe who isn't called a racist by saying \"muh niggas\".

If she asks you waht you are doing try something like \"i wanna make you feel good\" with a trusting look on you face , then slowly kiss her again. Once you have gotten into her pants, literally, DO NOT go straight for pussy, even if she is not wearing any underware, rub your hand over her pussy for a while, try to get the sides and avoid the middle, this will let suspese build. Make sure you do this over her panties/thorng if she is wearing one. Once this is done slowly slide your hand under her underware, removing pants as needed, and do the cunt rubbing thing again, stay away from the middle. Start discreetly feeling for her clit, it should feel like a little fleshy nub near the top, you may have to move some lip out of the way. From here you have two ways to proceed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRub her clit, this will make her cum, try to get some jucies on your finger, it will make things easier, watch how she responds since everyone ahs thier own preferance. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGo for the G-spot, if this is your or her first time dont do this. The G-spot is located about 2 inchs inside and is on the side facing you, use your index finger to stroke it, dont stay over it forever, try to put in a second finger, some like it and some dont, it you really want to drive her wild rub her clit with your thumb while you use you other fingers on her clit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter she cums dont keep on going, but dont stop until she is done. The purpose of fingering is NOT to simulate sex but to just stimulate her in general. Some guys will recommend a finger in or pressing against the ass, she will either really like it or think you are a pervert, do so at your own risk.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "fingerbang", "definition": "boy band from South Park", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "firefox", "definition": "Internet browser by Mozilla.

Hinduism does promise, however, a different form of \"eternal bliss\" and end to suffering. (explained below)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHinduism has many holy texts, but the most sacred are the Vedas and Upinashads. The Bhagavad Gita, a section of the epic Mahabarata, is sometimes referred to as the \"Hindu Bible\" because in this text the Lord Krishna relays the major points of the Hindu faith to Arjuna, a warrior hero. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe major beliefs of Hindus include reincarnation, karma (the belief that actions in this life will contribute to the quality of the next life. good actions yield good results, bad yields bad), and ahimsa (nonviolence to all living things). Ahimsa will help one attain good karma, which in turn will help him/her achieve a higher quality next life. The ultimate goal of the Hindu is to achieve moksha, or union with the eternal soul, Brahman. (since the ultimate goal is a union with THE eternal soul, Hinduism is fundamentally \"monotheistic,\" the visible manifestations of God such as Vishnu and Shiva are representations of Brahman, so that the human mind can comprehend it). Union with the eternal soul can be attained through meditation and yogic practices or dedication and devotion to one's duty. Because of this need for dedication to duty, the caste system was created by Krishna to keep people focusing on their jobs; HUMANS (not God) corrupted the system and discriminated against people of \"lower\" castes. Hinduism also urges people to be dispassionate because attachment to worldly objects is superficial and leads only to suffering. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToday, Hinduism is practiced mainly in India and Nepal, though it is spread throughout the world including the U.K., some countries in Africa, South America, and of course in the U.S.A.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "Hip Hop", "definition": "A name for the 4 elements of the late 70's New York City renaissance which includes break dancing, emceeing, (rapping) graffiti, and turntablism.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "Hip-Hop", "definition": "A culture and form of ground breaking music and self expression with elements that consisted of the elements of graffiti art, DJing, MCing, and breaking.

They are treacherous, best not to trust them. The aggression level is so high that they can't get on without killing each other, every excuse is good to start a military conflict, or at least humiliate the opposing side and show one's domination over the other side. Also, humans are very weird, for example, in a face to face contact to communicate you have not only use words, but also [mimics], [gesticulation] and the so called, overall \"body language\". All in all, they have a tendency for over expression of their feelings, yet sometimes they seem to have no real feelings at all or have extremely shallow feelings.

They also like lots of entertainment and they can't remain serious when required. It is also worth noticing that in the human societies the [Emotional Quotient] (also known as EQ, also known as inter personal intelligence or emotional intelligence) is far more important than the actual Intelligence Quotient, in other words: it's better if you are charming than if you are intelligent.

This is often used on the TV show South Park, where the children often ask questions about a situation until the folly in a parent's decision becomes clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSarcasm - Understatement, mocking overstatement, or heavy-handed irony (stating the flat opposite of the truth) where both parties are aware of the difference between what's said and what's actually happening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSituational Irony - The irony that most people think of.  A difference between what you expect to happen (in a story, for example) and what actually happens.  Rain on your wedding day would be a sort-of example, because a wedding day is generally expected to be a perfect, happy day.  The good advice you didn't take, however, would NOT be irony, because that has nothing to do with what is expected and what isn't expected.  A traffic jam when you're already late wouldn't be irony either; there's no automatic expectation that traffic will be fine, just because you happen to be late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIrony of Fate - The concept that the Gods, Fates, etc. are toying with humans for amusement by using irony.  Beethoven's loss of hearing is a famous example; one would expect a composer to be able to hear his compositions, but fate denied him that ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTragic (Dramatic) Irony - When the audience knows something that some of the characters don't know in a play/movie/novel/whatever. For example, when the horror flick psycho is in the house and the homeowner just goes in without suspecting anything.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "Irritable Vowel Syndrome", "definition": "When you or your Scrabble opponent has so many vowels on their rack, they can't make a word on the board, or the only word that can be made is going to score very low.

Somewhere along the line Jelly bracelets began to come back into style. When this happened they became known as fuck bracelets. What many of you are failing to realize is everyone just took it as a joke. No one actually believes that if they break someone's black bracelet that, that person has to have sex with them. That's ridiculous and stupid. However there is a meaning behind each of the different colors and people do jokingly try to break them a lot. Most of the time when it happens to me (I have about 80 of these things) it's just one of my friends kidding around. \r\n\r\nBlack- Sex \r\nBlue- Blow job \r\nPink- Flash tits or pinus \r\nYellow- Hug \r\nPurple- Kiss \r\nClear- W/e snapper wants \r\nGreen- Hand job \r\nBrown- Toss my salad \r\nGlow in the dark- SEX TOYS \r\nAny glitter- Girl chooses \r\nSilver(Gray)- OUTDOOR SEX \r\nLight Blue- Anal \r\nLight pink- hug & kiss \r\nLight green- Oral sex \r\nGold- All of the above \r\n\r\nThose are the meanings of the different colors.

(It is a nice [pipe dream] but human nature will forever stand in the way of that goal).\r\n\r\nMost libtards subscribe to the notion that \"people are basically good\", and build their foundation for activism and \"improving the human condition\" on that faulty premise. Because they deny the facts about human nature, their \"reasoning\" is diametrically opposite to common sense (blue states vs. red states).\r\n\r\nThe reality that people have different initiative levels, are basically selfish, and often work for their own interests before helping others, puts a libtard's [panties in a wad]. So, when citizens will not voluntarily comply with various libtard prescriptions for \"the common good\", then laws must be passed, or force used, to MAKE them comply. (It is the gradual path to totalitarianism).\r\n\r\nLikewise, his/her na\u00c3\u00afve cries of: \"can't we all just get along?\" and \"there is nothing worth dying for\" are red flags for anyone with a clue.\r\n\r\nMetaphorically speaking, a libtard is a sheep who thinks that their grasp of diplomatic nuance or metaphysical sensitivity will prevent their flock from being devoured by the world's Islamic/Communist wolves. When America, the sheep dog, responds to wolf attacks, the libtard judges these defensive actions as offensive and wolfish.\r\n\r\nSince libtards are unable to recognize our enemies for what they are, they cannot be trusted to safeguard our future.\r\n\r\n>>>>>\r\n\r\nIn a large nutshell, a libtard's goal in life includes one or more of the following:\r\n\r\n--the establishment of a Socialist \"utopia\" (a.k.a. a global [nanny state])\r\n--\"benevolent\" totalitarian control of the world's population through any means necessary\r\n--ever increasing government micromanagement of private enterprise (a.k.a. clueless meddling)\r\n--the adoption of laws, treaties and tax regulations that hinder America's competitiveness\r\n--the usurpation of the legislative process, at all levels, through judicial fiat\r\n--the filing of specious law suits in order to thwart the will of the people (e.g. Calif. Proposition. 187)\r\n--the promotion of the tyranny of the minority\r\n--the filing of specious law suits to shakedown corporations for cash (under the guise of \"social responsibility\")\r\n--the disproportionate taxation of citizens \"who have more money than they need\"\r\n--the redistribution of wealth from producers to non-producers (under the guise of \"fairness\")\r\n--the banning and confiscation of all privately owned guns (even though it has lead to genocide)\r\n--the abolition of all private property rights\r\n--the destruction of all national sovereignty (America first, of course)\r\n--the destruction of Capitalism\r\n--the establishment of one religion (with no personal accountability), OR the abolition of all religion\r\n--the appeasement of Islamic radicals and their American front groups like CAIR (see: [Religion of Pieces])\r\n--the regulation, or banning, of all opposition media (under the guise of \"fairness\")\r\n--the appeasement of Communist dictators and their American front groups\r\n--the further insertion of Socialist ideology and indoctrination into public school curricula\r\n--the purposeful \"dumbing down\" of the masses through inane public school curricula and pedagogy\r\n--mass thought control through \"speech codes\" and [political correctness]\r\n--the further promulgation of the homosexual/pedophile agenda\r\n--the teaching of HATE (superficially disguised as \"Women's Studies\", \"African Studies\", etc.)\r\n--the legalization of marijuana (\"far OUT, man\")\r\n--the establishment of world wide socialized medicine (under the guise of \"fairness\")\r\n--the conservation of the environment over the conservation of the American economy\r\n--the demonization of attempts to make English America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national language\r\n--world peace (which genocidal dictators define as: \"the absence of conflict\"--dead men cannot resist your brutal oppression)\r\n--the conservation of the environment over the conservation of humanity\r\n--the promotion of abortion as birth control, eugenics, and teaching the theory of evolution as fact (even though the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics precludes it from the get-go)\r\n--the abolition of individual freedom\r\n--anarchy\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, there is a thread of anti-Americanism that runs through these ideas. A libtard cannot stomach the idea that America, despite its faults, is the greatest country in the world. As such, he/she sees it as their duty to tarnish the country's current and past image using all available means including: cherry picking facts and using innuendo, half-truths, lies and fabrications (see: [Rathergate]).\r\n\r\nLibtards\u00e2\u0080\u0099 actions undermine America's educational system, economy, criminal justice system, military personnel, sovereignty, security, and freedoms. Meanwhile, they try to fabricate a moral equivalence with rogue nations like China, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Syria, Somalia and Sudan. (But don't question their patriotism).\r\n\r\nNOTE TO ALL MALCONTENTS: If America is truly evil, please pick yourself a better country.\r\n\r\nIf the health care system in Cuba, Canada or Great Britain is superior to America's, then you are free to leave. If the crime rate in China, North Korea or the [Magic Kingdom] is so much lower, then you too are free to leave. Not enough hedonism for you? Then try Amsterdam, Bangkok or Tijuana.\r\n\r\nIf life in general is better in Sweden, The Netherlands or Switzerland then WHY are you still here??? You talk big, but you lack the courage of your convictions. So do humanity a favor--shut up and move away.\r\n\r\nOtherwise get a real job, and get a life, because you obviously have WAY too much time on your hands.\r\n\r\n>>>>>\r\n\r\nBecause most libtards are pantheists (New Agers), agnostics, atheists, liberal Jews, liberal Catholics, or have otherwise turned their backs on Jehovah, they lack true spiritual fulfillment. In order to try and fill that void, and \"to make a difference\", they work for the causes listed above. A pretty complete listing can be found at discoverthenetworks.org.\r\n\r\nA libtard will participate in protests, rallies, marches, bike rides, etc. in a feckless attempt to change whatever supposedly needs changing (see: [muckadoo]). Their desire to revisit the \"glory\" days of the 60's is sometimes a driving force. Regardless, the end result is usually the same: nothing actually changes.\r\n\r\nBut, since a libtard wants to be rated for his/her good intentions, versus actual results, they leave these activities with a feeling of success \"because they have raised awareness\" or \"let their voices be heard.\" Post-protest gatherings often feature excessive drinking, drug abuse, and impromptu fornication to celebrate the \"victory.\" \r\n\r\nBecause conservatives take responsibility for themselves and their children, have real jobs, under gird the economy, and value their time, their counter protesting is often negligible.\r\n\r\nIt is not that they don't care about their causes; they just understand that 1968 tactics are useless. Likewise, their sense of self worth does not come from how well they perform at work, or in life, but from a realization that they have been given a good and satisfying destiny that no one can take away.\r\n\r\nWith all of this in mind, may we NOW question a libtard's patriotism???", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "Like shock", "definition": "When one gets many more likes/retweets/favorites on a social networking site than usual.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "liketurbate", "definition": "Liking your own post or comment on Facebook.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "Linkin Park", "definition": "Ok since everyone is just posting OPINIONS.

All the aircraft are identical, brightly coloured and three times as big as they need to be. The signs are huge and all point the same way. Whichever way you go, someone pops up dressed in a cloak and pointed hat insisting you follow him. Your luggage and clothes are taken off you and replaced with an XP Air suit and suitcase identical to everyone around you as this is included in the exorbitant ticket cost. The aircraft will not take off until you have signed a contract. The inflight entertainment promised turns out to be the same Mickey Mouse cartoon repeated over and over again. You have to phone your travel agent before you can have a meal or drink. You are searched regularly throughout the flight. If you go to the toilet twice or more you get charged for a new ticket.

The city sits at the mouth of the Mersey estuary and is currently enjoying a resurgence in fortunes. \r\n\r\nNow for all those fools who have criticised Liverpool and her people in these definitions, I think its time to address some grievances. I know many of you'll not like what I have to say, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tough S**T. So without any more chatter lets begin...\r\n\r\nAccusation: Scousers are all thieves! \r\nResponse: Liverpool has a lower crime rate then nearly all the major cities in Britain. Even taking population in to account, some notable cities which have higher crime rates include Manchester and London.\r\n\r\nAccusation: Liverpool has no culture!\r\nResponse : The city of Liverpool has more listed buildings than anywhere in the Britain, with the exception of Westminster. This is due to the fact that Liverpool had the worlds largest port from the 19th century up until the 20th. This meant Liverpool was alive with travellers from around the world, all bridging their culture with them. Indeed Liverpool has the oldest Chinese community in Europe, dating back 800 years. Not only this but the area surrounding the famous Liver buildings is a [unesco] world heritage site.\r\n\r\nWe have numerous art galleries, two amazing cathedrals, not to mention a great musical heritage. Many Scousers are also blessed with the ability to formulate a coherent argument explaining why idiots who insult our city are the quintessence of stupidity. Did I mention we have three universities, The university of Liverpool being responsible for coining the term red brick.\r\n\r\nAccusation: Liverpool is a shithole!\r\nResponse: Ever since the second world war, when Liverpool was the second most bombed city outside of London (somebody thought we were important), the city had never recovered. Despite being the centre for Atlantic command and the most important port in the Empire, once the war was over we were left to get on with it. The damage to the city was immense and the city did not receive the investment it needed to recover. When coupled with the decline in shipping, the result was many people out of work living in poverty. During a time when you needed money to get ahead, education was not a top priority and standards fell. As time went by, and due to the ignorance of others, little investment made its way into the city and stereotypes began to form. The city went in to serious economic decline.\r\n\r\nHowever there is now renewed optimism and ever increasing investment in to the city, e.g. the \u00c2\u00a31 billion pound grovesner Paradise project. The city is not a shit hole, but its not perfect, nowhere is. But I would rather live here than London(filled with many rude people).\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nLiverpool does have problems, it does have scum, thieves, and idiots but a lot less than some places I can think of. I am not going to criticise other cities because everywhere has its charms. The fact is that Liverpool people are very friendly, we put up with so much criticism that you learn to smile through it. Most Scousers don't hate Manchester by the way, just the idiots that criticise us. We are not racist, but Liverpool FC IS the most successful football club of all time.

Of course if you have the time to read through all of them you realise that these 10 features or reasons have been standard with the PC a long, long, long time. Some of the reasons are just plain myths that Apple invented. Probably because they ran out of fabricated facts.\r\n\r\nSo take the journey through the 10 commandments of a mac-enthusiast and enjoy their naive attitude towards personal computing.\r\n\r\n1. The Mac... It just works\r\n\r\nThis is maybe the ultimate reason a mac owner will give you to explain why it's superior to a PC. The mac owner will tell you that all people that own macs are really satisfied with their computers and would never switch back. This is ofcourse not true.\r\nThe mac owner will also tell you that with a system from Apple you will never have to think about drivers, upgrades or anything. A mac is perfection itself when delivered. Atleast according to their standard. Many macs can't even be upgraded. So what you buy is what you get. Expect your system to be outdated within 1-2 years.\r\nApple also states: \"Only with a Mac do you get an operating system built by the same people who built the computer it runs on.\". Actually Apple's Mac OS X (the operating system) is not based on their own technology, but by the technology of freeBSD. Apple's own capabilities in form of creating an operating system have been demonstrated in previous versions of Mac OS. It took an operating system based on someone else's technology to get a Mac multitasking and not behaving like an oversized pocket calculator from 1985.\r\n\r\n2. It doesn't crash\r\n\r\nYes it does! And it does it alot. The difference between a pc based on Windows crashing and a Mac is that on the pc the crash is in 99% of the cases caused by badly coded third party software, when the Mac just has a faulty operating system. Why else would Apple themselves run their india website on RedHat Linux?\r\nThere is another fun part about crashes on the mac, it's almost always impossible to trace the source of the crash. When your mac crashes you simply reinstall the system. Sounds like a fun thing to do on your spare time, well buy a Mac then!\r\n\r\n3. Simply the best in digital music\r\n\r\nThis point is actually based on Apple's iPod. I must admit, the iPod is not an ugly creation. I'll give Apple credit for that. But as always, they exaggerate the benefits of their product. Apple was far from first with creating a portable mp3-player with a built in harddrive but on the other side they do offer the most expensive solution.\r\nThe iPod is about 40-60% more expensive than technologically equal products. Keep in mind also that it offers no recording option and no belt clip. Two very crucial benefits a portable mp3-player should have.\r\n\r\n4. The missing link in digital photography\r\n\r\nIt's amazing! Apple has invented a program called iPhotos that will revolutionize the way we look at digital photos. Hear what they have to say: \"Simply drag your mouse, and iPhoto magically grows or shrinks your photo thumbnails. So you can view individual shots in detail or see hundreds of photos on the screen at once...\".\r\nMaybe mac users are new to digital photos on the computer but on the pc we have a huge variety of freeware that does the job of iPhoto and more, to choose from. So when Apple says that they are \"the missing link in digital photography\" maybe what they meant was that iPhoto is the missing link of the Mac.\r\nWindows users reached that stage of evolution ages ago.\r\n\r\n5. Your own digital entertainment center\r\n\r\nIt seems that Apple thinks that they've revolutionized computing by developing mediocre software for viewing digital photos, editing video, burning CDs and DVDs and listening to music. Well they haven't!\r\n\r\n6. Goes everywhere you go\r\n\r\nYou better sit down for this one, hold on to your seat and embrace yourself for some cutting edge news from Apple... they've invented the laptop, eureka! Not only that, they think they've made it superior to other laptops. Let's look at why and also try to answer their questions:\r\n\r\n    * Can your PC laptop go coast to coast with just one battery?\r\n      \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ofcourse. And if it only needs the performance of the Mac it could probably go around the world.\r\n    * Can you put the system to sleep just by closing the lid?\r\n      \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Oh my god, a Mac can do that? Well, so can a PC!\r\n    * Does it wake up instantly?\r\n      \u00e2\u0080\u0094Duh!\r\n    * Can your PC laptop automatically switch between Ethernet,\r\n      dial-up and wireless connections on the fly?\r\n      \u00e2\u0080\u0094Without a doubt!\r\n    * Without a restart?\r\n      Is this a joke? This really proves that Apple has no clue on what their competitors are doing. If they never have used a PC running Windows it makes their tests and objective sayings about the Mac really credible. Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic.\r\n\r\n7. It's built for the internet\r\n\r\nApple makes a huge point about the easability of configuring an internet connection on a mac. All new Windows versions come with just as easy to use guides for connecting to the internet with modem, lan or anything else. They also brag about such obvious tools of communication like email, favorites and contacts. Yes Apple, this is really new and hot stuff, you are indeed innovative. Or maybe not.\r\nThe worst part might be that they lie about their under average video-plugin Quicktime. This might be one of the worst programs ever to install. Actually if some students at a university needed an example of a really poorly written program, this would be a perfect opportunity for Quicktime to step into the limelight.\r\n\r\n8. Office is Office, and then some\r\n\r\nYes, the mac comes with Office and this is why you should make the switch from a pc to a mac:\r\n\r\n\"The transition to a Mac is easy in part because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue using the same applications you already know\"\r\n\r\nAsk yourself this: Why would I switch when It's the exactly same on the mac? -Beats me. Apple does speak of some mysterious features in this sentence:\r\n\r\n\"And thanks to exclusive features, the Mac versions improve on their Windows counterparts\"\r\n\r\nAs you might expect they mention nothing on what these features are. Well they're probably just wonderfully, perfectly and amazingly non-existent!\r\n\r\n9. Works effortlessly with PCs\r\n\r\nApple thought for a long time that they'd be best off constructing their own method for network-communication. Everyone that has struggled with the glorious AppleTalk knows that they didn't do a great job. Now they have realised that it's better to use an already working technology that someone else created instead of poorly reinventing the wheel.\r\n\r\n\"Networking on a Mac is built on the same technologies used by PCs.\"\r\n\r\nThey also reveal amazing means of medias you can use on your mac:\r\n\r\n...\"you can also swap files via data CD, floppies or Zip disks.\"\r\n\r\n10. It's beautiful\r\n\r\nApple emphasises that all their products are masterpieces of design. Their problem is that their focus on design hinders them from creating ergonomical and practical machines. If you have ever used the small round iMac mouse you have probably too suffered from aches in arm and hand.\r\n\r\n\"...ergonomic products that are the toast of the design world...\"\r\n\r\nIt wasn't I who brought up the word toast into the debate. On the other hand it was I who drew the paralell to machines looking like plain household machines. Who wants a computer that looks like a remnant from the 70's? You could probably achieve the same state of hallucination that you could by inhaling large amounts of heavy drugs.\r\n\r\nSo what have we learned from these 10 points that Apple provides for the potential buyer. We have learned that Apple likes to tell their future customers that the mac is built on technology they probably already are using on their PCs. They also lure the extremely naive buyers with words like internet, word-processing and cd-burning.\r\n\r\nPlease do not be fooled. You have nothing to gain by switching to a Mac.

I'm no member of any \"family\" you may think of.\r\n\r\nThe word itself has rather obscure origins, and its history and meaning is totally unrelated with modern concept of mafia.\r\n\r\nModern Mafias have so many different aspects I couldn't say if one is wronger than others. Nowadays the term \"Mafia\" can be rightly (and sadly) related to almost every socio-political aspect of our lives. We could say the word itself has gained a more general and complex meaning since its migration from Sicily to USA.\r\n\r\nAs regards the word itself: its origin can be traced back in the centuries. Sure it had something to do with the many invasions Sicily was exposed to. During the ages, Sicily has been invaded by pretty much ALL of the peoples in the Mediterranean Area: Greeks, Romans, Normands (~French), Arabs, Spanish, Italians nowadays. This gave the island's culture an inmense richness, but as a side effect created among Sicilians some sort of silent \"brotherhood\" against anyone coming from the outside world.\r\n\r\nThis \"brotherhood\", meaning protection of the masses from the invasors, lately degenerated into an oppression of the masses. The term mafia, originally indicating (not meaning) a group of people \"respected\" for being charismatic  members of that brotherhood, slightly but inesorably turned into a synonym for organized crime.\r\n\r\nMy personal idea is that the two different meanings still coexist in Sicilian culture, often originating a confusig and ambiguous mix.\r\n\r\nAs regards the \"international\" meaning... well I guess everybody has a very distorted prespective, maybe the best definition is \"Those loud mouth Italian criminals talking with gestures like in the class A movie The Godfather\"!", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "magcon", "definition": "A convention/tour of Vine famous boys.

It most frequently comes in tablet form, although it is occasionally sold in capsules or as powder. It is most frequently used orally and rarely snorted. MDMA use is closely tied to the underground rave (and dance club) scene throughout the world, but has also been widely used by therapists as an adjunct to psychotherapy. \r\n\r\nBecause MDMA is so popular and because it goes well with dance parties, the demand for it usually exceeds supply--especially at any given location on any given night. This creates an opening for unscrupulous individuals to sell virtually anything as 'ecstasy'. While 'ecstasy' is the popular name for MDMA, the functional definition of ecstasy is any pill represented as MDMA on the street. Ecstasy pills are notoriously unreliable in content, more so than most other street drugs, and commonly contain either caffeine, ephedrine, amphetamines, MDA, MDE, DXM, or--in rare cases--DOB, and don't necessarily contain MDMA or any psychoactive. This problem has led to the development of simple MDMA testing kits that may help give the user a general sense of the content of a pill.\r\n\r\nDose\r\nA standard oral dose of MDMA is between 80 - 150 mg. Most good quality pills contain somewhere in this range, generally 80-120 mg. A large percentage of users find that, unlike with many other psychoactives such as LSD or mushrooms, there is a 'sweet spot' in MDMA dosage. Once this spot is found, higher dosages are not particularly desirable as they don't increase the sought after effects or duration.\r\n\r\nPrice\r\nThe price of MDMA varies wildly depending on where it's purchased and in what quantity. A single tablet bought at a rave can cost as much as $50 though more commonly $20-$30. Purchased in higher quantities MDMA generally sells for $100-$250 per gram (about $10-25 per dose), with wholesale prices as low as $50 per gram.\r\n\r\nLaw\r\nMDMA is illegal in the United States (Schedule I) and in most other countries. It is also listed as Schedule I in the International Convention on Psychotropic Substances, an international drug control treaty. \r\n\r\nChemistry\r\n3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine (MDMA) is a synthetic chemical that can be derived from an essential oil of the sassafras tree.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nMDMA was first synthesized and patented by Merck pharmaceuticals in 1912 and patented in 1914, but it wasn't until the mid 1970s that articles related to its psychoactivity began showing up in scholarly journals. In the late '70s and early '80s MDMA was used as a psychotherapeutic tool and also started to become available on the street. Its growing popularity led to it being made illegal in the United States in 1985 and its popularity has continued to increase since then.\r\n\r\nSlang\r\nThe Substance : [MDMA], [ecstasy], [X], [XTC], [E], M, adam, [bean], [roll],\r\n\r\nThe Experience : X-ing, [rolling], [tripping], [wigging]\r\n\r\nOnset\r\nDepending on how much and how recently one has eaten, MDMA generally takes 30-60 minutes (although sometimes as long as 2 hours) to take effect. Unlike with many other psychoactives, the onset of MDMA is very quick. Often at the point one realizes that perhaps they are starting to notice effects, they are already 'launching' quickly towards the peak. This quick and extremely sharp 'launch' can be unnerving, feeling a bit like it's too quick and hard to know when it's going to end, but the feeling generally only lasts a few minutes until the full effects are reached\r\n\r\nDuration\r\nThe primary effects of MDMA last approximately 3-4 hours when taken orally. For many people there is an additional period of time (2-6 hrs) where it is difficult to go to sleep and there is definitely a noticeable difference from everyday reality, but which is not strong enough to be considered 'tripping'. Many people also experience a noticeable shift in mood for several days after use; for some this is a period of depression while others experience lifted mood.\r\n\r\nThe Experience\r\nWhen the full effects of MDMA manifest, barring an uncommon negative reaction, users are likely to find that suddenly everything is right with the world. The primary effects sought by those using MDMA recreationally are the emotional openness, euphoria, stimulation, reduction of critical and cynical thoughts, and decrease of inhibitions that can accompany its use. MDMA is used by some individuals in a therapeutic setting to attempt to work through difficult interpersonal issues. Although MDMA can cause nystagmus (eye wiggles), most individuals experience few prominent open or closed eye visuals. A small percentage of users report significant visual distortions.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "meatatarian", "definition": "A person who eats meat virtually to the exclusion of vegetables.

The clothing has a vintage, well-taylored, and peacockish look, favoring bright patterns, plenty of color, brands like Ben Sherman and Fred Perry, and slim-cut, three button suits (preferrably Italian) in the style of the sixties. The favored music of Mods is varied rather widely but, for the most part, shares the characteristic of being danceable. Favored genres include old school Ska, Soul, and R&B as well as New Wave, Britpop, and some things that, today, are heaped into the rather loose label of \"Alternative Rock\".\r\n\r\nAnother defining characteristic of Mods is their chosen mode of transportation, the Italian moterscooter (most notably Vespa and Lambretta). Not everyone who rides a scooter is Mod, however. These scooters tend to be in a retro style and sometimes heavily customized.\r\n\r\nUnlike the case with some other social subgroups, there exists no Mod ideology or philosophy(outside of a general avoidance of violence because of unwillingness to damage their clothes and the idea that, as The Who put it in one of their earliest songs \"you gotta be cool\").

Make sure you aren't one\r\nII. Major noob avoiding strategies\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nA. INTRO\r\n\r\nI. What is this?\r\nThis guide is designed to give you a better understanding of what a noob is, how to recognize them, some details about them, and how to avoid or get rid of them. It mostly applies to online forums, which are the main targets of migrating noobs.\r\n\r\nII. Defining 'Noob'\r\nContrary to the belief of many, a noob/n00b and a [newbie]/[newb] are not the same thing. [Newbs] are those who are new to some task* and are very beginner at it, possibly a little overconfident about it, but they are willing to learn and fix their errors to move out of that stage. [n00bs], on the other hand, know little and have no will to learn any more. They expect people to do the work for them and then expect to get praised about it, and make up a unique species of their own. It is the latter we will study in this guide so that the reader is prepared to encounter them in the wild if needed.\r\n\r\nNoobs are often referred to as [n00bs] as a sign of disrespect toward them, and it's often hella funny, but I will refer to them as noobs during this reading.\r\n\r\n* Usually the topic at hand on an internet forum.\r\n\r\nB. COMMON NOOB CHARACTERISTICS\r\n\r\nI. Noobish\r\nOften, but not always, noobs will attempt to communicate in their own primitive language, known as \"n00bish.\" It is a variant of the hacker language that exposes them as having little intelligence or will to learn. Here is an example of some noobish. Do not attempt to comprehend it: it cannot be discerned without professionals at hand.\r\n\r\nstFU /../..an, i r teh r0xx0rz liek emin3m, u cna go tO EHLL OR ATLE4St help m3 wit hthIS!!111!!!!!!!1~~1!!``!! LOLLOLOLLOLOLlOoLLOlollLLl u n00b\r\n\r\nAlthough you may find this unbelievably funny and/or annoying, it is best to restrain yourself and keep from talking back to them, as they are very territorial and easily angered. This will result in their attempted verbal abuse of you, possibly backed up by other noobs, because they work in packs when doing offensive tasks. It is not an easy task to learn this language because our intelligent accent will keep it from sounding quite right when spoken. You can write some simple noobish of your own, however, by slamming your face into your keyboard repeatedly.\r\n\r\nII. Where to find n00bs\r\nOn the internet, n00bs make their colonies on forums. They migrate in waves, usually on weekends, and proceed to clog up bandwidth with stupid questions and sometimes even stupid answers. If you happen to be unfortunate enough to be on a board large enough to attract migrating noobs, there will hopefully be authority in charge who is smart enough to take extermination measures before they can make nests and larger colonies. [THE BANNER HAMMER] is one form of authority.\r\n\r\nLarger colonies can result in the mutation of some into spammers. Not commercial spammers, but pointless spammers. A noob can become one of these at any point, but the larger the amount of noobs, the more chance pointless spammers will appear.\r\n\r\nOff the internet, noobs appear anywhere the focus is on learning or discussing something specific.\r\n\r\nIII. Behavior of noobs\r\nSince noobs are basically ignorant bastards, they have a lot in common. The most often seen characteristic is their fluency in noobish, which is why it got its own section. They will also be very self confident as if they were the absolute best at what they are in fact the worst at. Also, they are quite agressive and self-centered, and tend to laugh a lot using many L's and O's in rapid sucession (the noobish word for laughing like an ultimate retard).\r\n\r\nIt is their instinct to assemble in packs for defense, and they often attempt to organize packs that they call teams. Unfortunately for them, teams usually result in a total loss of communication and they can often begin to fight amongst each other. These teams are quite unlike those formed by non-noobs.\r\n\r\nNoobs have difficulty reading English and cannot comprehend the idea of authority.\r\n\r\nTherefore, they have an all-out disregard for rules, basic or not. A good way to identify a noob (bad) vs. a [newb] (good) is to tell them (or have an authority tell them) which rule they are unknowingly breaking. If they respond with an apology and fix it, they are probably not a noob. If they react by insulting everything around them in rapid noobish and causing general mayhem, it is because they are a noob and have had a small seizure due to their inability to understand what is happening.\r\n\r\nIV. Noob Religion\r\nNoobs follow a variation of the [1337] (sometimes [7331]) religion, in which they worship the number in odd rituals and put altars in their forum avatars and signatures. They often call themselves [1337], which experts say is somewhat like calling themselves godly in a human language. It's best to not interfere with their religious fantasies and practices because that can lead to a noob uprising, which can turn a forum to mush in less than a week.\r\n\r\nV. More about noob habitats\r\nNoobs often attempt to maintain their own web pages. Some common features of these lairs are a terrible lack of content, background music, lots of pointless animated gifs, and pages that say some variation of 'tHEir isnothinG H34r yEtt LOLLOLOL!111!1!!~~~!!`! 13371337', which means 'Nothing here yet' in noobish.\r\n\r\nThey will also have large, seemingly infinite marquees of 88X31 affiliate buttons replaced with red X's scattered here and there, and possibly a hit counter showing a number less than 100. These habitats are numerous but fairly easy to avoid because only noobs link to them. So if you can identify a noob, don't go to its homepage. Simple as that.\r\n\r\nC. AVOIDING NOOBS\r\n\r\nI. Make sure you aren't one\r\nNote: This section is bilingual so even noobs can make the discovery if they haven't already.\r\n\r\nEnglish (T4lk)-\r\n\r\nRead the above parts of this guide carefully. If you find yourself unable to comprehend any of it but are instead beginning to think about how great you are and how awesome 'teh 1337' is, you might want to take one of the many available online quizzes to check your noobancy.\r\n\r\nNoobish (133713371337)- Liek, u gott4 re3D teh gudieCAREFUl1y and tehn OMG LIEK I AM R0XX0RZ ya anD ify 0u turn into teh reTARDED u gota go 2 MY WEBP4GE LOLLOLOL!!111~11 ad check 4 warez n stfuu. if u r a n00b go2HELL LOLLOLOlROFLMFAO11!!!11!!!! a/s/l pos gtg n00b suxx0rz ur b0xx0rz OLOOOLOLLLL HELP HELP HELP 1337133713371337\r\n\r\nII. Major noob avoiding strategies\r\nThe main factor in attracting migrating herds of noobs is a large, active forum. If you find one of these, look to see if it has the management to avoid noob infestation. If not, look for a small or mid-sized forum that covers the same topic so you can enjoy your time there before the noobs find it.\r\n\r\nAnother way to keep noobs from interfering with your life is to become part of the authority on one of these forums. But that's often hard to do so you'll probably be better off avoiding larger forums first off. If you do manage to become part of the authority, however, take full advantage of it and establish extermination policies so that normal people can have a nice time without noob infestations.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "noob tube", "definition": "Any grenade launcher attachment used in Call of Duty 4 Modernwarfare, employed by n00bs of the highest caliber.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "normie", "definition": "A person who does not have a mental illness such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, mood disorders, PTSD, depression or any similar mental disability. \"Normie\" is a reference to those who are a part of the mainstream culture; the 97% of the population who do not have a mental illness.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "Norteno", "definition": "Spanish meaning \"Northerner\"; Nortenos claim red as their color and often wear red rags (bandanas) around their heads or hang them from their pockets.

The term rolling deep stems directly from the world of hardcore hip hop and gangsta rap, and is often used in conjunction with phrases like, \"Ya best proteck ya neck,\" \"bakdafukup,\" or other equally street-smart phrases that manage to incorporate both defensivness and threat. In any case, the implications are easily identifiable and the prmoise of quick retaliation looms in the foreground; rolling deep is a means of letting people know that you are not to be fucked with. The perils of being caught slippin' in this day and age are just too great. I know the value of rolling deep and have integrated it into my daily routine, rolling deep for such mundane tasks as getting a late- night snack from the fridge, buying a new sweater, or making a important phone call home. Hopefully some of the following tips, examples, and observations will acquaint you with the ways of rolling deep as fuck, 'cause it's too dangerous to be caught shallow.\r\n\r\nPut on the hardest clothes you can find (consult the latest number one video on Rap City) and practice scowling in the mirror for a few hours. The scowl is on the most integral aspects of rolling deep and must be perfected, although allowances can be made for the Flava-Flav type joker in every roup. Take a deep breath and tell yourself you are hard until you believe it. \r\nPretend you are in a rap video, running down the street in slow motion or backing up the MC. Visualize yourself as an actual member of a video posse. \r\nPractice the \"What the fuck?!\" arm gesture (both arms open, palms spread outward) until it becomes an automatic response to any question, especially if from a parent, cop, boss, or teacher. \r\nGrow some sort of \"hard\" facial hair. \r\nWear a very unhip pair of sunglasses--not bullshit Oakley or Arnet, but something like cop glasses or oversized mom-style glaasses. Basically anything you can snag out of a lost-and-found-bin will do. \r\nLook around a lot, like you expecting static from any direction. \r\nCultivate a fake limp or strut and walk extremely slowly. \r\nRefer to people only as \"bitches\" or \"fools.\" Learn to integrate the following words or phrases into your everyday speech, regardless of their meaning in your life: gat, nine, blast in the face, bitchslap, gangstalean, etc. \r\nYou are now ready to assemble the crew and synchronize the eight-step rolling deep program. Usually a larger group will signify a deeper roll, but this is not always the case. Certain people will never attain the ability to roll deep, no matter how much backup they have. Conversely, some motherfuckers roll deep when hanging out on solo tip. Some of the deepest rollers are the strong, silent types who can handles themselves in any situation. Consider the following list of some people who roll deep and some who don't quite make it.\r\n\r\nDeep As Fuck:\r\n\r\nWu-Tang, the Warriors (from that old '70s movie), this dude I once saw lounging in a designer sweatsuit and shades, Slayer.\r\n\r\nWading Pool:\r\n\r\nHammer, New Kids On The Block, Blackstreet, any fast food employee or manager, rock star snowboarders, bitch-ass rollerbladers.\r\n\r\nOf course those you new to the ways of rolling deep should never try to bust a flex on someone with experience. First things first, you should go in gradually, the way one would enter a pool of freezing water. You should initially roll deep only on inanimate objects such as street signs, a jammed or locked door, or a soda machine that shorted your coin. From that point you should work your way up to blind people or alley cats, but only when you feel comfortable. Progression will naturally lead you to flexin' on old ladies and infants. Get confident, live your lyrics, and work your way up to speed. Eventually you'll be able to walk the streets with pride and conviction that can only come with the knowledge that your are rolling deep.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "Ron Jeremy", "definition": "a man who gets more ass then a toilet seat", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "Ron Paul", "definition": "Sitting Texas Congressman and one time Libertarian Party presidential candidate.

Higher dose effects include extreme laughter, uncontrollable racing thoughts, colors changing and a feeling that each and every color gives a certain tone to your inner most being (hard to explain unless you've tried them), distortions of all senses, hyper awareness of taste, smell, music (listen to your favorite band), pictures coming to life and everything becoming three dimensional, or may cause extreme paranoia and/or uncontrollable crying.

Speed is amphetamine, a stimulating drug that triggers the brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reward system giving the user feelings of pleasure. Speed also goes by the street names \u00e2\u0080\u009cIce, Crystal meth and Shabu\u00e2\u0080\u009d 2 The drug works using Dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is used in all matters of the brain from learning to attentiveness. However, the most prominent usage of dopamine is to incite the brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reward system. Dopamine is released in the brain naturally when people eat, drink and have sex. 1 Dopamine is released into the synaptic space in between the pre and postsynaptic neurons. Here is where speed comes in. Speed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal (Speed doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have a goal it merely exists, but this is the reason people use it) is to trigger a buildup of Dopamine. Speed first enters the Terminal Button in one of several ways. Speed is very similar on a molecular level to Dopamine so Speed can enter the Dopamine transporter or speed can diffuse into the neuron. The amphetamine then expels the dopamine out into the synaptic space. It does this through a process that forces the Dopamine transporters to go in reverse. Under natural circumstances Dopamine is brought back into the terminal button through the Dopamine reuptake pumps. These pumps do not work as well when speed is present in the brain and the Dopamine remains longer as a result. \u00e2\u0080\u009c[Speed also] inhibit[s] monoamine oxydase A (MAO-A).\u00e2\u0080\u009d1 Speed also forces glutamate to come into the synaptic space. The result of this is dopamine will flow more easily. \r\n\tThe effects people notice with amphetamines make it clear why the drug has earned the name speed. Speed makes everything go faster. When on the drug, which can be taken in forms of powder, pills and injections, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour heart rate\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 blood pressure and movements all increase [in speed].\u00e2\u0080\u009d 2 It also makes sleep difficult.  The size of the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pupils increase and weight loss becomes easier. While the user is \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh\u00e2\u0080\u009d off the drug he or she can expect \u00e2\u0080\u009cto feel good, [be more willing to] take risks and be excited\u00e2\u0080\u009d.2 Speed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-term effects are for the most part similar to many other drugs. Speed causes depression, personal problems, anger and violence. Speed is also addicting. There is one more side effect that is more unique to the drug. This side effect is coined psychosis. Psychosis is a serious psychological problem. People that suffer from it hear voices in their head, become delusional and paranoid. Psychosis victims are known to see things that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there and often feel that ordinary objects and people want to hurt them.4.

The S U P R A's beginnings were humble. Back in the days of roller rinks and AC/DC 8 track cassettes (enjoy your iPod, youngsters) there was the Celica. Unlike the modern Celica, the 1970s era model was a little car, scoffed at by Firebird-driving Burt Reynolds fans. Then came the \u00e2\u0080\u009880s (okay, \u00e2\u0080\u009879), and a new kind of Celica...the Celica S U P R A! But it wasn't Super. Its suspension was better suited for back seat lovin' than high speed racing and everyone knew it. It made do with a single overhead cam CRESSIDA engine. But hey, it was better than the Celica, and a step in the right direction, with disc brakes all around. \r\n\r\nIn 1981 another Celica S U P R A was released. It was DOHC this time around, and had independent rear suspension, but was still basically a Celica.  \r\nBy 1986 the first true S U P R A was born. No longer just a \u00e2\u0080\u009csporty\u00e2\u0080\u009d Celica, this S U P R A was designed to stand on its own. Toyota went all out with its new Flagship. It sported a new engine design (the 7M-GTE) built around a 3 liter inline 6 cylinder engine and\u00e2\u0080\u0094get this\u00e2\u0080\u0094a TURBO and INTERCOOLER!! This packed 230 bhp @ 5600 rpm. Impressive stuff in \u00e2\u0080\u009886. Sadly, Toyota released the car in America WITHOUT the turbo and intercooler, which dropped output to 200 bhp. And the car wasn't light at over 3400 lbs. Critics panned the styling as generic and overly conservative (looking eerily like a Porsche 944 knockoff). But again, it made strides of progress with reworked suspension geometry, fatty (for the day) tires, improved brakes, and Toyota's TEMS \u00e2\u0080\u009cElectronic Modulated Suspension\u00e2\u0080\u009d for on-the-fly selectable shock absorber rates. Just press \u00e2\u0080\u009cSport\u00e2\u0080\u009d and go. But was it a true sports car? Not really. The third generation S U P R A was more of a Grand Tourer.   \r\n\r\nIn \u00e2\u0080\u009887 the 3rd Gen Turbo and intercooler setup finally came stateside in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cS U P R A Turbo\u00e2\u0080\u009d and caught the attention of the mullet crowd. Still, the S U P R A was not quite an icon. Perhaps it was the extra gristle, which took the car's weight up to a portly 3600 pounds (if you got the sport roof). Its 6.8 psi of boost was commendable, but not enough to lay a solid claim to the throne held by domestic muscle, or exotic style.  \r\n\r\nBut all that would change in 1993 with the 4th generation S U P R A...the JZA80. This is the S U P R A that has become legendary. THIS is the S U P R A you will use in SRS to lay waste to the competition.   \r\n\r\nUnlike any previous S U P R A, this one was so completely restyled that it was as if it just fell out of the sky. It had TEN insectoid looking lights forward of the front wheel well! And that Spoiler! WHOA! It was huge, functional, and didn't block your scanning for Police in the rear view. Gone were the harsh wedge-like angles of the \u00e2\u0080\u009880s, replaced by the muscular curves that would come to symbolize 1990s automotive design. Back seats and cargo space were an afterthought. The JZA80 was new from the ground up, and built with the goal of producing incredible power and saving weight in every conceivable way. \r\n\r\nAnd save weight it did. As if obsessed, the engineers trimmed in ways only they could have conceived of. When the assembly line rolled in Motomachi, Japan, they started with conventional wisdom to save weight. They built the hood, roof and bumper supports out of aluminum. Makes sense. They used cast aluminum 17 inch rims. Sounds good. But get this, further weight savings came via a PLASTIC fuel tank and hollow anti-roll bars.  That's dedication. Then they just lost their damned minds. They used hollow head BOLTS wherever structurally feasible and (I'm not making this up) even went so far as to create hollow fiber CARPET in an effort to tip the scales.   \r\n\r\nWith weight minimized, they looked to power. Toyota's name for power is 2JZ-GTE. Simply put, the 2JZ is 3 liters of DOHC 24-valve, Inline Six, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmiddle finger\u00e2\u0080\u009d to anyone who doubted Toyota's ability to build a race ready engine. It is the ultimate weapon in Toyota's production arsenal and has seen tuned versions exceed 800 bhp! This block would be called upon to do double duty not only for Toyota's S U P R A line, but would almost single-handedly carry the Lexus brand as well. The Lexus SC300 and GS300 would come to use this mighty platform, and even the IS300 uses a detuned version of it.  \r\n\r\nThat detuned version can also be found in the base model JDM S U P R A (SZ-R). In that configuration the 2JZ is naturally aspirated and can crank out 220 bhp at 5800 rpm. Not exactly pure power, but like I said...base model. Now in JDM S U P R As like the mighty RZ the 2JZ engine shows its potential. The RZ sees the glorious return of the turbo. It straps on sequential twin turbos and an intercooler, which catapult it into the 276 bhp (or 280 PS) range. The car is capable of much more, but Toyota willingly limited the power to 280 PS to maintain the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgentleman's agreement\u00e2\u0080\u009d that was in place among Japanese auto manufacturers at the time.  \r\n\r\nFortunately for S U P R A fans, America doesn't count. In general, Japanese sports cars are released in America in a watered down form. Look at any J-Spec rocket, and compare it to the U.S. Spec. It'll make you sad. One of the only exceptions was when Toyota unleashed the S U P R A on America. Unshackled from the agreement in place in Japan, the U.S. S U P R A Turbo is a monster that even an RZ owner would fear. \r\n\r\nPower jumps up from 276 bhp in the RZ to 320 bhp of whup-ass thanks to 11.6 psi of boost in the U.S. Turbo. It has torque enough to bench press a Celica without breaking a sweat, twisting 315 lb-ft @ 4000 rpm, and through some sort of mad scientist wizardry, 90 percent of that torque is available from 1300 to 4500 rpm. Mate this to a GETRAG six speed (short throw) and you've got serious neck SNAP potential.  \r\n\r\nThis S U P R A can crush you into your seat for the 5 seconds it takes to hit 60, and can run a quarter mile in the mid 13s if you are brave enough to push the needle to the 6800 rpm redline. And while the S U P R A is electronically limited to 155 mph, the Speedometer's  180 mph max is telling. With limiter disabled, the car can hit 170, stock.  \r\n\r\nLeft to mere mortals this much power would get most of us killed, but Toyota has provided some assistance for the ham fisted and lead footed. For a start the S U P R A has a Traction Control System which detects wheel spin, and in those hairy moments between \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh $#!T\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cCall a tow truck,\u00e2\u0080\u009d applies rear brakes, retards engine ignition timing and controls a sub-throttle valve until the wheels regain grip. Then there's a Torsen (Torque-sensing) LSD at the rear, to keep the corners manageable. And the brakes are massive, nearing 13 inches in rotor diameter with 4 piston calipers up front and 2 piston in the rear. These are thankfully slotted up front, and functional brake scoops channel air to cool the rear brakes, as if they somehow  knew you'd need to stop from ridiculous velocities without pesky brake fade. Lateral G-sensing 4-channel ABS controls front and rear inside and outside brake assists independently so that even when stomping wildly into corners (as this car could prompt you to do) the brakes resist lockup.    \r\n\r\nThank you, Toyota. After over a decade of trying, the S U P R A has surpassed its namesake. It's no wonder the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cS U P R A\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cLegendary\u00e2\u0080\u009d became synonymous with the JZA80.  Sadly, like so many Japanese greats, this wondrous car is no longer in production. But much like with the RX-7, there are whispers of the return of the S U P R A in the next few years. With a new GT-R coming from Nissan in 2007, will we see the S U P R A return in all its glory?

Fueled by racism, this group did not exist prior to the election of our first African American President. These people share many similar traits to your common Wal*Mart white trash yet have the uncanny drive to create sharpie signs with words on them they will never understand. Their cultural icons are Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, and Sarah Palin. While most of these toothless rejects don't possess the mental capacity to blink while walking without falling down, at some point they've been made to feel that their ignorant bigoted opinions are worth something more than the welfare checks they receive monthly. Which has led to many comical protests that resemble a trailer park circus. They are not to be taken seriously considering there are currently no professional wrestlers currently considering a Presidential bid.

The tattoo is placed on the face to further humiliate the victim and mark them in a place where they could not cover the mark.\n\nConfusion about it's meaning has come from the victim's having to explain the tattoo when they get out of prison and have to explain it to family and loved one's. They would often state that they got the tattoo because they killed a man in prison. This statement was not far from the truth since their submissive act of becoming another man's \"bitch\" could easily be viewed as the death of their manhood.\n\nProblems arose when men on the outside began to get the tattoos and brag that it signified their killing someone or lost a loved one.

He succeeded, if naively, with his first release under the name \"[Nine Inch Nails]\", Pretty Hate Machine in 1989.\r\n\r\nHe proved he could outdo himself with an 8-song EP stopgap \"Broken\" between his first release and his next. \"Broken\" was a solid expression of passion and fury. One of his best moments.\r\n\r\nHe followed up with \"Fixed\", an EP with remixes of \"Broken\" Songs.\r\n\r\nIn 1994, Trent broke into the mainstream with the titanic success of \"The Downward Spiral\". It contained his most commercially famous songs, the infamous \"Closer\"  and \"Hurt\", which was later beautifully covered by Johnny Cash. \"The Downward Spiral\" was spun off with several remix EPs, including the extremely popular \"Further Down the Spiral\" and the dreaded by parents \"Closer to God\".\r\n\r\nTrent and [NIN] (Nine Inch Nails) spent a terribly long time touring \"The Downward Spiral\" and afterwards, Trent had no idea what to do. This allegedly led to alcohol and coaine abuse. He got into rehab and was soon producing the LONG-AWAITED \"The Fragile\". When it finally came out in 1999, it was met with extreme love by most fans but with loathing by critics who said he was \"losing his touch\". He effectively said \"FUCK YOU\" to these people with the huge success of \"The Fragile\".\r\n\r\nTrent fell again into the downward spiral of alcohol addiction after a full two tours of \"The Fragile\".

Bonus points if wizardesque clothing is worn!\r\n\r\nRules: At the beginning of the game, players decide on any special rules, including at which point a boss must be fought. Boss fighting will be discussed later but generally it happens every 3rd or 5th level. See the \"Special Rules\" section for further explanation. As well, if a prize is to be played for, it should be presented or decided on before play begins. After rules are decided and agreed upon (might be a good idea to write them down in case any late comers come in), all players open their first beverage. When a player has finished his or her first beverage they are now a \"Level 1 Wizard\". This is important since you can only call yourself a \"Level X Wizard\" when you have finished X number of beers. They must then \"Level Up\" by retrieving a full beverage, placing it on top of the now empty can, and securely taping the two together. FYI one or two good wraps of duct tape where the cans meet is usually sufficient, you don't want to over do it or you'll run out. Game play continues in this manner, leveling up after finishing each beverage until the pre-determined \"boss fighting\" level has been reached. \r\n\r\nBoss Fighting: This occurs once you are have finished your 5th beer, assuming you chose to fight a boss every 5th level (3rd beer for every 3rd, etc...). You cannot \"Level Up\" to a \"Level 5 Wizard\" (or whatever you chose) until you have fought a boss. This is done by choosing a hard liquor to take a shot of. Your choice is now called \"Boss 'name of liquor'\" i.e.: Jose Cuervo becomes either \"Boss Jose\" or \"Boss Cuervo\". Ideally, at least one other player will need to fight the boss with you, and it is considered acceptable to wait for them to finish a level to \"fight\" with you. As well, other players are encouraged to assist you in your \"battle\" with the boss, however doing so will not exempt them from fighting another boss when they reach the \"boss fighting level\". All players involved in the \"battle\" must pour a full shot of chosen liquor and then cheers and take it together. Once all shots are gone, the boss in considered defeated and all players needing to level up may now do so. Again, it's important to note that the boss comes at the end of the level; players \"Leveling up\" to Level 5 (or 3) will be getting their 6th (or 4th) beverage, and will retain \"Level 5 Wizard\" (or 3) status until they have finished it. No boss should be repeated until players have done battle with all available bosses.\r\n\r\nMini-Games: Players may choose to play other drinking games while playing Wisest Wizard. This is acceptable and encouraged! However, the rules as to how many levels can be obtained by winning a game should be decided on in advance to avoid confrontations later on. Our favorite is \"Wizard Chess\" better know to the layman as [Beirut] or [Beer Pong]. No changes to the game are made, however the winners of each game are awarded two levels (in the form of empty cans) each to add to their staffs. Losers get nothing as they lost the match. Any other game may be played as long as the levels to be awarded at the end are pre-determined. Simple games such as [Jacks and Fives] do not need any additional levels to be awarded as drinking will commence in a usual manner.\r\n\r\nSpecial Rules: As stated above, additional rules can be submitted at the beginning of the game to further enhance game play. All special rules and subsequent penalties for breaking the rule must be agreed upon by all players who are present at the beginning in order to be official. Any players arriving later in the game are automatically subjected to them. Examples of special rules are:\r\n - Appropriate Wizard Lingo must be used whenever possible:\r\n  - \"I'm feeling drunk\" = \"I'm feeling wise\"\r\n  - \"I need another beer\" = \"I need to Level Up\"\r\n  - \"Let's play Beirut\" = \"Let's play some Wizard Chess\"\r\nand so and so forth. \r\n - Current \"Wisest Wizard\" gets to create a rule upon \"Leveling up\". These rules are similar to rules from [King's Cup] and can either be permanent or last until he (or the new wisest wizard) levels up. Generally it's a good idea to set a starting point for this rule to come into effect, such as level 10 or 12, to avoid too many rules being created.\r\n\r\nWinning: In the end, everyone wins thanks to the copious amount of beverages that end up being consumed. However, the person who achieves the highest level is eligible to win a prize that was determined at the beginning of the game. This can either be by the end of the night/next morning or at a pre-determined time, depending on what works better for the game.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "Wiz Khalifa", "definition": "A hip-hop artist from Pittsburgh, Cameron Jibril Thomaz also known as Wiz Khalifa has released several albums under the \tRostrum / Warner Brothers record label.

Most rappers can't do that in their career. He made songs to dance to, political songs, and songs telling stories. He did all that while sounding very pleasant, having controversial issues every day and having millions waiting for his orders. Those things make him a must have on any greatest rappers list.\r\n\r\n[Notorious B.I.G]-Undoubtly one of the best. His skill freestyling and story telling is by far the best (in my opinion) that hip-hop music will ever see. Though his career was short lived, he will always be remembered and lived on through his music.\r\n\r\n[Nas]-Nas is my favorite rapper. Since his first release (Illmatic) to his work with the Firm to his last release (Street's Disciple) Nas has been one of the best. The lyrics of every song and the way he flows is unique and will never be seen again by a new rapper. He also managed to fall off the charts, then come back with one of the best albums (Stillmatic). From beef with BIG, beef with 2pac, and beef with Jay-Z, Nas has remained poised and great. Listen to any of his albums and you'll see why he is one of the greatest.\r\n\r\n[Eminem]-This may seem shocking but I beleive Eminem is one of the all time greats. If you listen to the Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP, and The Eminem Show, you'll see his greatness. His songs can make you laugh, or fire you up to a point beyond beleif. He can also fire back at any critism (Who Knew, Cleanin' Out My Closet, ect.). Eminem has dealt with protestors and being a white rapper.

Scientific name Homo Coprophagus Somnambulus. \r\n\r\nA deceased human being who has partially returned to life due to undeterminable causes. The brain retains base facilities, namely gross motor function. In its near-mindless state, it grasps no remains of emotion, personality, or sensation of pain. In rare cases, some of the reanimated have reflexively preformed routine activities from their past lives.\r\n\r\nThe rotting bodies of the undead operate on a fraction of the level at which our bodies normally function. Circulatory, respiratory, and digestive systems are unaffected by reanimation. Labored breathing, choking, and moaning are reflexive but no oxygen is carried through the blood. The nervous system functions primarily within the brain and brain stem. Sensory reception is minimal at best and seemingly unecessary in the pursuit of prey. The undead are incapable of fatigue and will persist at any cost. They will even crawl when their legs have been removed. Even if the head is removed from the body, it will continue to live. The only way to stop the reanimated is to destroy the brain. To prevent reanimation in the recently departed, decapitate the corpse and burn the body. \r\n\r\nThe only observable action a zombie takes part in is killing living creatures, especially humans, and eating them. Many theories and speculations surround this disturbing behavior. One theory is based on the thought that reanimation is the result of a contagious infection or virus, and that the primal drive to feed will spread the disease to other host bodies. Research has shown that although the majority of zombie attacks result in fatal wounds, all corpses return to life soon after passing, regardless of cause of death. Another theory is that zombies eat the brains of the living to refuel the \"un-life\" giving chemical serotonin. Because digestive and circulatory systems are incapable of bringing these elements to the brain, this just cannot be true. The final speculation seems the most obvious, that the dead feed for sustenance to satiate their unnatural metabolism. But because the gut has no function in the undead, this is also false. One documented encounter claims that a zombie was unable to move due to the sheer mass of undigested flesh resting in its distended gut. The creature continued to eat even after it's gut had burst open. Studies regarding the nature of feeding have proven that zombies will try to eat when their stomachs and even jaws have been removed. One explanation offers that the walking dead are the incarnation of death itself, a mockery of life that uses the vessels of the living to carry out their dark intentions, they are the opposite of life and are driven to simply undo it.", "tags": ["urban-dic"], "gender": "male"}, {"word": "Zombie Company", "definition": "1.
