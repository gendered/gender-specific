These scales are ornamented with microscopic lines, and are of various and often very bright colors. By covering the transparent membrane of the wings they form the beautiful patterns much admired in these insects. See cut in next column, and cut under Lepidoptera.

When the horoscope of birth was not known, astrologers were accustomed to determine elections chiefly by the place and phase of the moon, whose influence was, however, considered debile. It appears that in the case of the lady of the story, the moon was impedited in the root of nativity (see Almansor, Prop. 35: \u201cCum in radice nativitatis impedietur luna,\u201d etc.), and Mars, a planet most unfavorable to journeys, was at azir, or lord of the ascendant, at her birth, and was in the fourth, or darkest, house; so that the omens of the journey were as gloomy as they well could be.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "root", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "In music, an evening song; especially, such a song sung by a lover at the window of his lady.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "serenade", "gender": "female"}, {"definition": "The cow-pea is a bean rather than a pea, having large leaves with three leaflets and seeds frequently oblong or kidney-shaped.

In the southern United States it has long been of great value, and with the introduction of mixed farming is increasingly appreciated. It is available for forage and soiling and for hay, in the latter use, when well cured, ranking with red clover; and it is one of the foremost nitrogen-gatherers.

By derivation and by Biblical usage atonement and reconciliation are essentially the same: two that were alienated are made at one, or put back into friendship. Atonement, however, is not now applied to the relation of man to man, except in its extra-Biblical extension, by which it means also the making of full and satisfactory amends (satisfaction) or the enduring of proper penalties (expiation) for a great wrong: as, there could be no atonement for such an outrage. As applied to the relations of God and man, atonement has been lifted into much greater dignity than any other word in the list; it is now the august, chosen, and only endeared word for the effect of the life and especially of the death of Christ in establishing right relations between God and man; reconcile and reconciliation are the principal words for this in the New Testament, atonement being used only once, and atone not at all. Propitiation is the only one of these words having exclusive reference to the feelings or purposes of the person or being offended; it is a severe word, implying slowness to relent, and is, in regard to the attitude of God toward man, chiefly a theological term. Expiation regards the guilt of the offense; it is the suffering of the penalty proper for an act (as, to make expiation for one's crime upon the scaffold), or of an adequate substituted pain. The word is general, and only barely Biblical (Num. xxxv. 33, margin, and revised version), although the fact is by the mass of Christians believed to lie in some form in the sufferings of Christ. Satisfaction in this connection means adequate amends: as, satisfaction for an insult or for damage; the word has been taken by a school in theology to express the sufficiency of the sufferings of Christ to meet the demands of the retributive justice of God.", "tags": ["wordnik"], "word": "propitiation", "gender": "male"}, {"definition": "A man who speaks on behalf of another or others.

Discipline is essentially the same as training, but more severe. Nurture, by its derivation, expresses a tender, continuous, and protracted training, beginning at an early age. Cultivation, in the active sense, is often used of the training, discipline, or development of some single department of the nature: as, the cultivation of the understanding, the taste, the conscience.

Companion, literally a messmate, applies where the persons are much thrown together, but are not united by any strong tie; hence it is not a good synonym for husband or wife. \u201cMany men may be admitted as companions who would not be altogether fit as associates,\u201d Crabb, Eng.

Formerly ally was nearly equivalent in meaning to associate, but it is now applied chiefly to states or rulers in their public capacity: as, the allies in the Crimean war.
