These scales are ornamented with microscopic lines, and are of various and often very bright colors. By covering the transparent membrane of the wings they form the beautiful patterns much admired in these insects. See cut in next column, and cut under Lepidoptera.

In the southern United States it has long been of great value, and with the introduction of mixed farming is increasingly appreciated.

By derivation and by Biblical usage atonement and reconciliation are essentially the same: two that were alienated are made at one, or put back into friendship. Atonement, however, is not now applied to the relation of man to man, except in its extra-Biblical extension, by which it means also the making of full and satisfactory amends (satisfaction) or the enduring of proper penalties (expiation) for a great wrong: as, there could be no atonement for such an outrage. As applied to the relations of God and man, atonement has been lifted into much greater dignity than any other word in the list; it is now the august, chosen, and only endeared word for the effect of the life and especially of the death of Christ in establishing right relations between God and man; reconcile and reconciliation are the principal words for this in the New Testament, atonement being used only once, and atone not at all. Propitiation is the only one of these words having exclusive reference to the feelings or purposes of the person or being offended; it is a severe word, implying slowness to relent, and is, in regard to the attitude of God toward man, chiefly a theological term. Expiation regards the guilt of the offense; it is the suffering of the penalty proper for an act (as, to make expiation for one's crime upon the scaffold), or of an adequate substituted pain. The word is general, and only barely Biblical (Num. xxxv. 33, margin, and revised version), although the fact is by the mass of Christians believed to lie in some form in the sufferings of Christ.

Cutters tend to be perfectionists, and often are white, middle class teenage girls, although not all cutters come from this background. \r\n\r\n      Cutting often is a result of depression, and some view it as a way to release emotional pain when it feels like you would explode otherwise.  Although many people think that those with depression have experienced huge tramas in their lives, this is not necessarily the case.  Depression is a disease, just like diabetes is a disease.  It can strike anyone, regardless of their gender, class, or social status.  I personally am attending an ivyleague college next year, was captain of my soccer team in high school, could be considered among the popular kids at my school, and have an extremely loving family. I still have the scars from my cutting, which I stopped doing 2 months ago.  Although i was lucky enough to be able to stop, other people such as my older sister, became addicted.

Home to three million people, some really sweet cities, three great univerties, a whole bunch of stellar small private colleges and a ton of true natural beauty in its lush northeast bluff country and statewide river valleys, lakes, and yes, rolling fields.  Iowa is a national leader in education (students in many other states including Texas take the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, and everyone's heard of the ACT, based in Iowa City) and is leading the way in biofuels to reduce the nation's dependence on oil.  To dispel the ignorance displayed elsewhere on this post, here's a state breakdown of cities and topography.  If seventy synonyms for boobs is alright to post, so is this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCentral Iowa:  [Des Moines], located at the intersection of I-80 and I-35, is the largest city with a metro of a half million and is the state capital, second only to London for the title of insurance capital of the world.  [Ames] (80,000 metro) is about a half hour north of Des Moines and is home to [Iowa State University], a land grant school of 30,000 respected around the world for its engineering and agricultural programs.  Central Iowa is, outside of river vallies, very flat, and outside of the Des Moines area and Ames is very sparsely populated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEastern Iowa:  The most densely populated area of the state.  Ethnically diverse [Iowa City] (115,000 metro) was Iowa's first state capital, was the first city in the world to elect a female mayor, has been named the most cultured city per capita in the nation, is always in the top five cities in the country for education, and is home to the [University of Iowa], 30,000, nationally renowned for its Carver College of Medicine and Iowa Hawkeye athletics.  The music departments of Iowa City's two large public high schools have won a total of five Grammy awards.  [Cedar Rapids], (200,000 metro) just twenty minutes north of Iowa City in the beautiful Cedar River valley, is the second largest single city, is the economic hub of eastern Iowa, has two private colleges, and is best known for being the place you get any of your Quaker Oats brand ceral from.  [Waterloo/Cedar Falls], two conjoined cities (130,000 metro) is where the [Unviersity of Northern Iowa], 18,000, is located.  The [Quad Cities], (375,000 metro) two in Iowa and two in Illinois, straddle the Mississippi and form the largest metro between Des Moines and Chicago.  The largest of the four cities is [Davenport], IA, home to the Bix 7 foot race whose hilly course and large prize attract runners from every part of the globe.  [Dubuque], (90,000 metro) on the Mississippi where Iowa meets Illinois and Wisconsin, is Iowa's oldest city. It is home to a ton of beautiful architecture, four private colleges, a far-reaching ELCA Lutheran seminary, and the Smithsonion affiliated National Mississippi River Musem and Aquarium.  Eastern Iowa's topography is for the most part very rolling farmland, with the exception of the hillier Iowa river valley, Cedar river valley, and the bluffs and hills skirting the whole eastern border along the Mississippi.  The northeast corner of the state is all bluffland, home to small town Decorah and reputed Luther College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWestern Iowa:  The vast majority of Iowa west of I-35 is flat farmland with the exception of the very westernmost strip.  [Sioux City] on the Missouri river (the western border) is a good sized city with nice amenities and lots of historyt.  [Council Bluffs] is the largest suburb of Omaha, just across the river in Nebraska.  The Iowa Great Lakes region contains many large lakes, most notably lake Okoboji, one of only three blue water lakes in the world.

That is not the case of manga. There are 6-7 major types of manga, each having its own audience. Kodomo manga is for children. Shonen manga is for boys ages 12-18 , Shoujo manga is for gilrs age 12-18. Josei manga is for adult ladies above the age of 20, mainly working women. Seinen manga is for young men between the ages of 18 and 30, and Hentai manga is pornographic, adult manga.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, saying \"comics from Japan\" is wrong. Another difference between manga and Western comics is that each comics volume has its own plot, while manga volumes all follow the same plot. The artwork is VERY different. Manga has its own particular artwork, especially when it comes to human faces, particularly the eyes, chin, nose, mouth, forehead... Manga is also read from RIGHT to LEFT.

All that I write are historical facts.\r\r\r\rPalestine was the name of the country between the Jordan river on the east, the Sinai desert on the south and the territory of Lebanon on the North. The name of the country came from the name of the ancient powerful nation that lived in it in the time of the Bible, Plishtim.\r\rThrough the history, the country was ruled by many differant empires troughout the ages like the Romans, the Bizanties, the Saracens, the Crusadersand, and the Ottoman empire. (and NOT just \"ruled by Arabs for 1000 years\" like some one before me said).\r\rUntil the year 1918, the country was ruled (for 400 years) by the Ottoman empire. In 1918, Britanny conquered Palestine and started ruling it as a Mandate (temporary government that is meant to prepare the land under its control for independant national government).\r\rIn the ending of the 19th century, the \"Zionist organisation\" was formed by European Jews, and, because of the wake of Jewish nationalism, started searching for territorial answers for \"the problem of the Jews, a nation without a country\". One of the answers was, very obviously, Palestine (also named Zion for Jerusalem), which Jews saw for centuries as their true land, where they were banished from, and dreamed of returning to. This started a great wave of immigration to Palestine, that increased troughout the beginning of the 20th century.\r\r\r\rUnlike what someone here said, the Palastinians were NOT always a nation. In fact, for years in Palastine lived Arab peasants, almost all of them uneducated. They saw themselves as Arabs, muslims who lived in Palestine, and had no nationalistic identity.\r\rIf you want the truth, Palestini nationalism awakened only in the 1920's. This, is when more educated Palastini Arabs realised that the Jews are intending to take over Palestine (with the massive immigration and purchasing of land), and the Mufti (religious Muslim leader) Haj Amil el-Huseini decided to take action:\r\rHe declared that the Jews want to take over the el-Aktza mosque, immediatly gaining the support of Muslim countries and turning the nationalistic war into a religious war. That immediatly increased the [anti-cemitism] in Arab countries.\r\r\r\rThe nationalistic struggle increased towards the 40's, and keeps going until today. However, the wake of Palestini nationality happened too late- when they started real fighting, there were more Jews in Palestine than Arabs.\r\r\r\rI would like to add another fact: In 1947, there was a vote in the UN, and it was declared officially that in Palestine two states would be formed: A Jewish country, and an Arab country. A year later, a Jewish county called Israel was formed. However, a Palastinian country was not formed UNTIL TODAY, in spite of the fact they were given many opportunities to do so.\r\r\r\rAlso, about the six-day war: it is a terrible rude lie to claim that Israel was losing. In fact, the war was so well planned, that in the first day of war all of the Egyptian and Yardeneese airforce was destroyed. Israel did not want to go to this war, but the Arab countries were gaining too much power and put Israel in danger. Israel also tried  convincing Jordan not to join, but it refused, losing many territories. The six day war was a complete defeat to Syria, Egypt and Jordan, and the USA had nothing to do with it.\r\rEgypt and Syria, however, took revenge for their loss in 67 six years later, when they attacked Israel in 73, causing Israel great loses in men and millitary power. However, even this war, Israel managed to win. \r\r\r\rI am not trying to take either one's side, all I am saying are facts, and the fact is: The Jews rule Israel now, while the Palastinians can't do anything about it. Nothing at all. True, Israel does not do anything it can to help the Palastinians, but take into account again the fat that the Jews formed a country long ago, while the Palastinians didn't. \r\rIs it because they can't?

Over time, it has been influenced by merengue - a fast paced danceable music also native to the Dominican Republic - and by a variety of Latin American guitar styles.\r\r\r\rThe music itself is played in 4/4. The most recognizable aspect of bachata instrumentation is the use of an amplified guitar (either electric or acoustic) whose sound has been doctored with a flanger, reverb, echo, or a combination of the three. The use of arpeggiated chords as the basis for the melody is almost standard. An additional guitar, usually mixed at a lower volume, may be used to provide a basic backbeat, although an electric bass guitar may be used instead. The use of bongo drums as to provide both syncopation and occasional percusive accents is also a feature of bachata; bongo solos during chorus breaks in bachata songs are rather common.", "gender": "male", "word": "bachata", "tags": ["urban-dic"]}, {"definition": "baseball as a sexual metaphor\r\r\r\rGoing up to bat: Attempting\r\rBullpen: Foreplay\r\r1st base: French kissing\r\r2nd base: Above the waist\r\r3rd base: Below the waist\r\rHome Run: Sex\r\rGrand Slam: Four times in twelve hours\r\rFoul Ball: Ass sex\r\rStrike out: Not getting it up\r\rLine Drive: One night stand\r\r10 Run Rule: Finishing on your own\r\rPop fly: Stealing virginity\r\rBunt: Pre-mature ejaculation\r\rGapper: Easy lay\r\rBases loaded: Threesome\r\rThird base coach: The person who's filmming \r\rStealing bases: Rape (rape is bad)\r\rDouble/Triple play: Multiple Orgasms\r\rCup: condom\r\rSteroids: Birth control\r\rError: No Orgasm\r\rBroken Bat: Broken dick\r\rExtra Innings: Four times in a row\r\rBench Warmer: Peeping Tom\r\rBat boy: [Fluffer]\r\rField: Heartshaped bed\r\rDugout: Back seat of a car", "gender": "male", "word": "Bases", "tags": ["urban-dic"]}, {"definition": "A politically progressive [California] city of 110,000 across the Bay from [San Francisco].\r\r\r\rHome of the [Free Speech Movement], [Creedence Clearwater Revival], [Green Day], [Counting Crows], and the [University of California] (Go Bears!)

The city sits at the mouth of the Mersey estuary and is currently enjoying a resurgence in fortunes. \r\n\r\nNow for all those fools who have criticised Liverpool and her people in these definitions, I think its time to address some grievances. I know many of you'll not like what I have to say, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tough S**T. So without any more chatter lets begin...\r\n\r\nAccusation: Scousers are all thieves! \r\nResponse: Liverpool has a lower crime rate then nearly all the major cities in Britain. Even taking population in to account, some notable cities which have higher crime rates include Manchester and London.\r\n\r\nAccusation: Liverpool has no culture!\r\nResponse : The city of Liverpool has more listed buildings than anywhere in the Britain, with the exception of Westminster. This is due to the fact that Liverpool had the worlds largest port from the 19th century up until the 20th. This meant Liverpool was alive with travellers from around the world, all bridging their culture with them. Indeed Liverpool has the oldest Chinese community in Europe, dating back 800 years. Not only this but the area surrounding the famous Liver buildings is a [unesco] world heritage site.\r\n\r\nWe have numerous art galleries, two amazing cathedrals, not to mention a great musical heritage. Many Scousers are also blessed with the ability to formulate a coherent argument explaining why idiots who insult our city are the quintessence of stupidity. Did I mention we have three universities, The university of Liverpool being responsible for coining the term red brick.\r\n\r\nAccusation: Liverpool is a shithole!\r\nResponse: Ever since the second world war, when Liverpool was the second most bombed city outside of London (somebody thought we were important), the city had never recovered. Despite being the centre for Atlantic command and the most important port in the Empire, once the war was over we were left to get on with it. The damage to the city was immense and the city did not receive the investment it needed to recover. When coupled with the decline in shipping, the result was many people out of work living in poverty. During a time when you needed money to get ahead, education was not a top priority and standards fell. As time went by, and due to the ignorance of others, little investment made its way into the city and stereotypes began to form. The city went in to serious economic decline.\r\n\r\nHowever there is now renewed optimism and ever increasing investment in to the city, e.g. the \u00c2\u00a31 billion pound grovesner Paradise project. The city is not a shit hole, but its not perfect, nowhere is. But I would rather live here than London(filled with many rude people).\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nLiverpool does have problems, it does have scum, thieves, and idiots but a lot less than some places I can think of.

Of course if you have the time to read through all of them you realise that these 10 features or reasons have been standard with the PC a long, long, long time. Some of the reasons are just plain myths that Apple invented. Probably because they ran out of fabricated facts.\r\n\r\nSo take the journey through the 10 commandments of a mac-enthusiast and enjoy their naive attitude towards personal computing.\r\n\r\n1. The Mac... It just works\r\n\r\nThis is maybe the ultimate reason a mac owner will give you to explain why it's superior to a PC. The mac owner will tell you that all people that own macs are really satisfied with their computers and would never switch back. This is ofcourse not true.\r\nThe mac owner will also tell you that with a system from Apple you will never have to think about drivers, upgrades or anything. A mac is perfection itself when delivered. Atleast according to their standard. Many macs can't even be upgraded. So what you buy is what you get. Expect your system to be outdated within 1-2 years.\r\nApple also states: \"Only with a Mac do you get an operating system built by the same people who built the computer it runs on.\". Actually Apple's Mac OS X (the operating system) is not based on their own technology, but by the technology of freeBSD. Apple's own capabilities in form of creating an operating system have been demonstrated in previous versions of Mac OS. It took an operating system based on someone else's technology to get a Mac multitasking and not behaving like an oversized pocket calculator from 1985.\r\n\r\n2. It doesn't crash\r\n\r\nYes it does! And it does it alot. The difference between a pc based on Windows crashing and a Mac is that on the pc the crash is in 99% of the cases caused by badly coded third party software, when the Mac just has a faulty operating system. Why else would Apple themselves run their india website on RedHat Linux?\r\nThere is another fun part about crashes on the mac, it's almost always impossible to trace the source of the crash. When your mac crashes you simply reinstall the system. Sounds like a fun thing to do on your spare time, well buy a Mac then!\r\n\r\n3. Simply the best in digital music\r\n\r\nThis point is actually based on Apple's iPod. I must admit, the iPod is not an ugly creation. I'll give Apple credit for that. But as always, they exaggerate the benefits of their product. Apple was far from first with creating a portable mp3-player with a built in harddrive but on the other side they do offer the most expensive solution.\r\nThe iPod is about 40-60% more expensive than technologically equal products. Keep in mind also that it offers no recording option and no belt clip. Two very crucial benefits a portable mp3-player should have.\r\n\r\n4. The missing link in digital photography\r\n\r\nIt's amazing! Apple has invented a program called iPhotos that will revolutionize the way we look at digital photos. Hear what they have to say: \"Simply drag your mouse, and iPhoto magically grows or shrinks your photo thumbnails. So you can view individual shots in detail or see hundreds of photos on the screen at once...\".\r\nMaybe mac users are new to digital photos on the computer but on the pc we have a huge variety of freeware that does the job of iPhoto and more, to choose from. So when Apple says that they are \"the missing link in digital photography\" maybe what they meant was that iPhoto is the missing link of the Mac.\r\nWindows users reached that stage of evolution ages ago.\r\n\r\n5. Your own digital entertainment center\r\n\r\nIt seems that Apple thinks that they've revolutionized computing by developing mediocre software for viewing digital photos, editing video, burning CDs and DVDs and listening to music. Well they haven't!\r\n\r\n6. Goes everywhere you go\r\n\r\nYou better sit down for this one, hold on to your seat and embrace yourself for some cutting edge news from Apple... they've invented the laptop, eureka! Not only that, they think they've made it superior to other laptops. Let's look at why and also try to answer their questions:\r\n\r\n    * Can your PC laptop go coast to coast with just one battery?\r\n      \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ofcourse. And if it only needs the performance of the Mac it could probably go around the world.\r\n    * Can you put the system to sleep just by closing the lid?\r\n      \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Oh my god, a Mac can do that? Well, so can a PC!\r\n    * Does it wake up instantly?\r\n      \u00e2\u0080\u0094Duh!\r\n    * Can your PC laptop automatically switch between Ethernet,\r\n      dial-up and wireless connections on the fly?\r\n      \u00e2\u0080\u0094Without a doubt!\r\n    * Without a restart?\r\n      Is this a joke? This really proves that Apple has no clue on what their competitors are doing. If they never have used a PC running Windows it makes their tests and objective sayings about the Mac really credible. Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic.\r\n\r\n7. It's built for the internet\r\n\r\nApple makes a huge point about the easability of configuring an internet connection on a mac. All new Windows versions come with just as easy to use guides for connecting to the internet with modem, lan or anything else. They also brag about such obvious tools of communication like email, favorites and contacts. Yes Apple, this is really new and hot stuff, you are indeed innovative. Or maybe not.\r\nThe worst part might be that they lie about their under average video-plugin Quicktime. This might be one of the worst programs ever to install. Actually if some students at a university needed an example of a really poorly written program, this would be a perfect opportunity for Quicktime to step into the limelight.\r\n\r\n8. Office is Office, and then some\r\n\r\nYes, the mac comes with Office and this is why you should make the switch from a pc to a mac:\r\n\r\n\"The transition to a Mac is easy in part because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue using the same applications you already know\"\r\n\r\nAsk yourself this: Why would I switch when It's the exactly same on the mac? -Beats me. Apple does speak of some mysterious features in this sentence:\r\n\r\n\"And thanks to exclusive features, the Mac versions improve on their Windows counterparts\"\r\n\r\nAs you might expect they mention nothing on what these features are. Well they're probably just wonderfully, perfectly and amazingly non-existent!\r\n\r\n9. Works effortlessly with PCs\r\n\r\nApple thought for a long time that they'd be best off constructing their own method for network-communication. Everyone that has struggled with the glorious AppleTalk knows that they didn't do a great job. Now they have realised that it's better to use an already working technology that someone else created instead of poorly reinventing the wheel.\r\n\r\n\"Networking on a Mac is built on the same technologies used by PCs.\"\r\n\r\nThey also reveal amazing means of medias you can use on your mac:\r\n\r\n...\"you can also swap files via data CD, floppies or Zip disks.\"\r\n\r\n10. It's beautiful\r\n\r\nApple emphasises that all their products are masterpieces of design. Their problem is that their focus on design hinders them from creating ergonomical and practical machines. If you have ever used the small round iMac mouse you have probably too suffered from aches in arm and hand.\r\n\r\n\"...ergonomic products that are the toast of the design world...\"\r\n\r\nIt wasn't I who brought up the word toast into the debate. On the other hand it was I who drew the paralell to machines looking like plain household machines. Who wants a computer that looks like a remnant from the 70's? You could probably achieve the same state of hallucination that you could by inhaling large amounts of heavy drugs.\r\n\r\nSo what have we learned from these 10 points that Apple provides for the potential buyer. We have learned that Apple likes to tell their future customers that the mac is built on technology they probably already are using on their PCs. They also lure the extremely naive buyers with words like internet, word-processing and cd-burning.\r\n\r\nPlease do not be fooled. You have nothing to gain by switching to a Mac.

LOLLOLOLLOLOLlOoLLOlollLLl u n00b\r\n\r\nAlthough you may find this unbelievably funny and/or annoying, it is best to restrain yourself and keep from talking back to them, as they are very territorial and easily angered. This will result in their attempted verbal abuse of you, possibly backed up by other noobs, because they work in packs when doing offensive tasks. It is not an easy task to learn this language because our intelligent accent will keep it from sounding quite right when spoken. You can write some simple noobish of your own, however, by slamming your face into your keyboard repeatedly.\r\n\r\nII. Where to find n00bs\r\nOn the internet, n00bs make their colonies on forums. They migrate in waves, usually on weekends, and proceed to clog up bandwidth with stupid questions and sometimes even stupid answers. If you happen to be unfortunate enough to be on a board large enough to attract migrating noobs, there will hopefully be authority in charge who is smart enough to take extermination measures before they can make nests and larger colonies. [THE BANNER HAMMER] is one form of authority.\r\n\r\nLarger colonies can result in the mutation of some into spammers. Not commercial spammers, but pointless spammers. A noob can become one of these at any point, but the larger the amount of noobs, the more chance pointless spammers will appear.\r\n\r\nOff the internet, noobs appear anywhere the focus is on learning or discussing something specific.\r\n\r\nIII. Behavior of noobs\r\nSince noobs are basically ignorant bastards, they have a lot in common. The most often seen characteristic is their fluency in noobish, which is why it got its own section. They will also be very self confident as if they were the absolute best at what they are in fact the worst at. Also, they are quite agressive and self-centered, and tend to laugh a lot using many L's and O's in rapid sucession (the noobish word for laughing like an ultimate retard).\r\n\r\nIt is their instinct to assemble in packs for defense, and they often attempt to organize packs that they call teams. Unfortunately for them, teams usually result in a total loss of communication and they can often begin to fight amongst each other. These teams are quite unlike those formed by non-noobs.\r\n\r\nNoobs have difficulty reading English and cannot comprehend the idea of authority.\r\n\r\nTherefore, they have an all-out disregard for rules, basic or not. A good way to identify a noob (bad) vs. a [newb] (good) is to tell them (or have an authority tell them) which rule they are unknowingly breaking. If they respond with an apology and fix it, they are probably not a noob. If they react by insulting everything around them in rapid noobish and causing general mayhem, it is because they are a noob and have had a small seizure due to their inability to understand what is happening.\r\n\r\nIV. Noob Religion\r\nNoobs follow a variation of the [1337] (sometimes [7331]) religion, in which they worship the number in odd rituals and put altars in their forum avatars and signatures. They often call themselves [1337], which experts say is somewhat like calling themselves godly in a human language. It's best to not interfere with their religious fantasies and practices because that can lead to a noob uprising, which can turn a forum to mush in less than a week.\r\n\r\nV. More about noob habitats\r\nNoobs often attempt to maintain their own web pages. Some common features of these lairs are a terrible lack of content, background music, lots of pointless animated gifs, and pages that say some variation of 'tHEir isnothinG H34r yEtt LOLLOLOL!111!1!!~~~!!`! 13371337', which means 'Nothing here yet' in noobish.\r\n\r\nThey will also have large, seemingly infinite marquees of 88X31 affiliate buttons replaced with red X's scattered here and there, and possibly a hit counter showing a number less than 100. These habitats are numerous but fairly easy to avoid because only noobs link to them. So if you can identify a noob, don't go to its homepage. Simple as that.\r\n\r\nC. AVOIDING NOOBS\r\n\r\nI. Make sure you aren't one\r\nNote: This section is bilingual so even noobs can make the discovery if they haven't already.\r\n\r\nEnglish (T4lk)-\r\n\r\nRead the above parts of this guide carefully. If you find yourself unable to comprehend any of it but are instead beginning to think about how great you are and how awesome 'teh 1337' is, you might want to take one of the many available online quizzes to check your noobancy.\r\n\r\nNoobish (133713371337)- Liek, u gott4 re3D teh gudieCAREFUl1y and tehn OMG LIEK I AM R0XX0RZ ya anD ify 0u turn into teh reTARDED u gota go 2 MY WEBP4GE LOLLOLOL!!111~11 ad check 4 warez n stfuu. if u r a n00b go2HELL LOLLOLOlROFLMFAO11!!!11!!!! a/s/l pos gtg n00b suxx0rz ur b0xx0rz OLOOOLOLLLL HELP HELP HELP 1337133713371337\r\n\r\nII. Major noob avoiding strategies\r\nThe main factor in attracting migrating herds of noobs is a large, active forum. If you find one of these, look to see if it has the management to avoid noob infestation. If not, look for a small or mid-sized forum that covers the same topic so you can enjoy your time there before the noobs find it.\r\n\r\nAnother way to keep noobs from interfering with your life is to become part of the authority on one of these forums. But that's often hard to do so you'll probably be better off avoiding larger forums first off. If you do manage to become part of the authority, however, take full advantage of it and establish extermination policies so that normal people can have a nice time without noob infestations.", "gender": "male", "word": "Noob", "tags": ["urban-dic"]}, {"definition": "Short for \"No Reason Boner.\"  Generally, an erection that has no inherent cause other than a young man's hormones going crazy.

The S U P R A's beginnings were humble. Back in the days of roller rinks and AC/DC 8 track cassettes (enjoy your iPod, youngsters) there was the Celica. Unlike the modern Celica, the 1970s era model was a little car, scoffed at by Firebird-driving Burt Reynolds fans. Then came the \u00e2\u0080\u009880s (okay, \u00e2\u0080\u009879), and a new kind of Celica...the Celica S U P R A! But it wasn't Super. Its suspension was better suited for back seat lovin' than high speed racing and everyone knew it. It made do with a single overhead cam CRESSIDA engine. But hey, it was better than the Celica, and a step in the right direction, with disc brakes all around. \r\n\r\nIn 1981 another Celica S U P R A was released. It was DOHC this time around, and had independent rear suspension, but was still basically a Celica.  \r\nBy 1986 the first true S U P R A was born. No longer just a \u00e2\u0080\u009csporty\u00e2\u0080\u009d Celica, this S U P R A was designed to stand on its own. Toyota went all out with its new Flagship. It sported a new engine design (the 7M-GTE) built around a 3 liter inline 6 cylinder engine and\u00e2\u0080\u0094get this\u00e2\u0080\u0094a TURBO and INTERCOOLER!! This packed 230 bhp @ 5600 rpm. Impressive stuff in \u00e2\u0080\u009886. Sadly, Toyota released the car in America WITHOUT the turbo and intercooler, which dropped output to 200 bhp. And the car wasn't light at over 3400 lbs. Critics panned the styling as generic and overly conservative (looking eerily like a Porsche 944 knockoff). But again, it made strides of progress with reworked suspension geometry, fatty (for the day) tires, improved brakes, and Toyota's TEMS \u00e2\u0080\u009cElectronic Modulated Suspension\u00e2\u0080\u009d for on-the-fly selectable shock absorber rates. Just press \u00e2\u0080\u009cSport\u00e2\u0080\u009d and go. But was it a true sports car? Not really. The third generation S U P R A was more of a Grand Tourer.   \r\n\r\nIn \u00e2\u0080\u009887 the 3rd Gen Turbo and intercooler setup finally came stateside in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cS U P R A Turbo\u00e2\u0080\u009d and caught the attention of the mullet crowd. Still, the S U P R A was not quite an icon. Perhaps it was the extra gristle, which took the car's weight up to a portly 3600 pounds (if you got the sport roof). Its 6.8 psi of boost was commendable, but not enough to lay a solid claim to the throne held by domestic muscle, or exotic style.  \r\n\r\nBut all that would change in 1993 with the 4th generation S U P R A...the JZA80. This is the S U P R A that has become legendary. THIS is the S U P R A you will use in SRS to lay waste to the competition.   \r\n\r\nUnlike any previous S U P R A, this one was so completely restyled that it was as if it just fell out of the sky. It had TEN insectoid looking lights forward of the front wheel well! And that Spoiler! WHOA! It was huge, functional, and didn't block your scanning for Police in the rear view. Gone were the harsh wedge-like angles of the \u00e2\u0080\u009880s, replaced by the muscular curves that would come to symbolize 1990s automotive design. Back seats and cargo space were an afterthought. The JZA80 was new from the ground up, and built with the goal of producing incredible power and saving weight in every conceivable way. \r\n\r\nAnd save weight it did. As if obsessed, the engineers trimmed in ways only they could have conceived of. When the assembly line rolled in Motomachi, Japan, they started with conventional wisdom to save weight. They built the hood, roof and bumper supports out of aluminum. Makes sense. They used cast aluminum 17 inch rims. Sounds good. But get this, further weight savings came via a PLASTIC fuel tank and hollow anti-roll bars.  That's dedication. Then they just lost their damned minds. They used hollow head BOLTS wherever structurally feasible and (I'm not making this up) even went so far as to create hollow fiber CARPET in an effort to tip the scales.   \r\n\r\nWith weight minimized, they looked to power. Toyota's name for power is 2JZ-GTE. Simply put, the 2JZ is 3 liters of DOHC 24-valve, Inline Six, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmiddle finger\u00e2\u0080\u009d to anyone who doubted Toyota's ability to build a race ready engine. It is the ultimate weapon in Toyota's production arsenal and has seen tuned versions exceed 800 bhp! This block would be called upon to do double duty not only for Toyota's S U P R A line, but would almost single-handedly carry the Lexus brand as well. The Lexus SC300 and GS300 would come to use this mighty platform, and even the IS300 uses a detuned version of it.  \r\n\r\nThat detuned version can also be found in the base model JDM S U P R A (SZ-R). In that configuration the 2JZ is naturally aspirated and can crank out 220 bhp at 5800 rpm. Not exactly pure power, but like I said...base model. Now in JDM S U P R As like the mighty RZ the 2JZ engine shows its potential. The RZ sees the glorious return of the turbo. It straps on sequential twin turbos and an intercooler, which catapult it into the 276 bhp (or 280 PS) range. The car is capable of much more, but Toyota willingly limited the power to 280 PS to maintain the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgentleman's agreement\u00e2\u0080\u009d that was in place among Japanese auto manufacturers at the time.  \r\n\r\nFortunately for S U P R A fans, America doesn't count. In general, Japanese sports cars are released in America in a watered down form. Look at any J-Spec rocket, and compare it to the U.S. Spec. It'll make you sad. One of the only exceptions was when Toyota unleashed the S U P R A on America. Unshackled from the agreement in place in Japan, the U.S. S U P R A Turbo is a monster that even an RZ owner would fear. \r\n\r\nPower jumps up from 276 bhp in the RZ to 320 bhp of whup-ass thanks to 11.6 psi of boost in the U.S. Turbo. It has torque enough to bench press a Celica without breaking a sweat, twisting 315 lb-ft @ 4000 rpm, and through some sort of mad scientist wizardry, 90 percent of that torque is available from 1300 to 4500 rpm. Mate this to a GETRAG six speed (short throw) and you've got serious neck SNAP potential.  \r\n\r\nThis S U P R A can crush you into your seat for the 5 seconds it takes to hit 60, and can run a quarter mile in the mid 13s if you are brave enough to push the needle to the 6800 rpm redline. And while the S U P R A is electronically limited to 155 mph, the Speedometer's  180 mph max is telling. With limiter disabled, the car can hit 170, stock.  \r\n\r\nLeft to mere mortals this much power would get most of us killed, but Toyota has provided some assistance for the ham fisted and lead footed. For a start the S U P R A has a Traction Control System which detects wheel spin, and in those hairy moments between \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh $#!T\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cCall a tow truck,\u00e2\u0080\u009d applies rear brakes, retards engine ignition timing and controls a sub-throttle valve until the wheels regain grip. Then there's a Torsen (Torque-sensing) LSD at the rear, to keep the corners manageable. And the brakes are massive, nearing 13 inches in rotor diameter with 4 piston calipers up front and 2 piston in the rear. These are thankfully slotted up front, and functional brake scoops channel air to cool the rear brakes, as if they somehow  knew you'd need to stop from ridiculous velocities without pesky brake fade. Lateral G-sensing 4-channel ABS controls front and rear inside and outside brake assists independently so that even when stomping wildly into corners (as this car could prompt you to do) the brakes resist lockup.    \r\n\r\nThank you, Toyota. After over a decade of trying, the S U P R A has surpassed its namesake. It's no wonder the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cS U P R A\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cLegendary\u00e2\u0080\u009d became synonymous with the JZA80.  Sadly, like so many Japanese greats, this wondrous car is no longer in production. But much like with the RX-7, there are whispers of the return of the S U P R A in the next few years.

But it was not pronounced as it is today.\n\nSounding more like 'onion,' the term was applied because of the field hands' skill at avoiding the labor they were hired to do. Whenever there was hard work in the offing, these 'onionists' would begin clamoring to go to the adjoining field to take a leek.\n\nThe term quickly won widespread acceptance and beame a source of endless mockery and derision. Humiliated, the early onionists worked desperately to erase the moniker but it stuck like glue.\n\nAbout 1797, however, they perfected and bankrolled a scheme where, working in concert with Smythe-Scrimshaw (one of London's largest lexicograpical publishers), they managed to change the accepted pronunciation to what it is today.\n\nTheir plan took some seven years to unfold and was far too complicated to explain here but history records they finally brought an end to popular knowledge of their earliest and most favored pursuits.", "gender": "male", "word": "Union", "tags": ["urban-dic"]}, {"definition": "University of Never Leaving Vegas\n\nThe only university that students who have spent the majority of their life in Vegas will ever go to.

Vicodin also has very severe withdrawal effects, similar to those of heroin, although not as severe. \r\n\r\nVicodin is perscribed for mild to severe pain often after a surgery, but sometimes for long-term use. Vicodin is produced by Knoll Labratories and comes in three varieties. Vicodin (5 mg hydrocodone, 500 mg acetaminophen), Vicodin ES (7.5/750), Vicodin HP (10/660). There is also many generic variants of Vicodin. \r\n\r\nVicodin is often taken for recreational use because it gives an amazing, euphoric body high. Vicodin is most commonly taken orally in pill form or crushed up and insufflated (snorted). Snorting results in slightly more powerful effects which come into effect much faster. Acetaminophen is extremely harmful to the liver in high doses (2,000+ mg) so often times, for recreational use, people will extract the hydrocodone from the pill resulting in an extremely vile liquid which can be taken orally or rectally via syringe (not very common, but people do it). \r\n\r\nThe most common side effects include itching, nausea, paranoia, and intense sweating even if it's not really hot. The severity of the side effects depends on the dose taken. 10-15 mg is considered a moderate dose and 20-30 mg is a high dose.

Scientific name Homo Coprophagus Somnambulus. \r\n\r\nA deceased human being who has partially returned to life due to undeterminable causes. The brain retains base facilities, namely gross motor function. In its near-mindless state, it grasps no remains of emotion, personality, or sensation of pain. In rare cases, some of the reanimated have reflexively preformed routine activities from their past lives.\r\n\r\nThe rotting bodies of the undead operate on a fraction of the level at which our bodies normally function. Circulatory, respiratory, and digestive systems are unaffected by reanimation. Labored breathing, choking, and moaning are reflexive but no oxygen is carried through the blood. The nervous system functions primarily within the brain and brain stem. Sensory reception is minimal at best and seemingly unecessary in the pursuit of prey. The undead are incapable of fatigue and will persist at any cost. They will even crawl when their legs have been removed. Even if the head is removed from the body, it will continue to live. The only way to stop the reanimated is to destroy the brain. To prevent reanimation in the recently departed, decapitate the corpse and burn the body. \r\n\r\nThe only observable action a zombie takes part in is killing living creatures, especially humans, and eating them. Many theories and speculations surround this disturbing behavior. One theory is based on the thought that reanimation is the result of a contagious infection or virus, and that the primal drive to feed will spread the disease to other host bodies. Research has shown that although the majority of zombie attacks result in fatal wounds, all corpses return to life soon after passing, regardless of cause of death. Another theory is that zombies eat the brains of the living to refuel the \"un-life\" giving chemical serotonin. Because digestive and circulatory systems are incapable of bringing these elements to the brain, this just cannot be true. The final speculation seems the most obvious, that the dead feed for sustenance to satiate their unnatural metabolism. But because the gut has no function in the undead, this is also false. One documented encounter claims that a zombie was unable to move due to the sheer mass of undigested flesh resting in its distended gut. The creature continued to eat even after it's gut had burst open. Studies regarding the nature of feeding have proven that zombies will try to eat when their stomachs and even jaws have been removed.
